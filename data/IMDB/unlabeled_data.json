        "text": "as with all of angelopoulos films the suspended step of the stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work dialogues are sparing with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters inner conflicts doubts or feelings the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters identities for themselves as a result the acting is understated and implicit as opposed to overt and explicit the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation where the viewer is asked to become a participant to participate as an actor by probing his or her own psyche as in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the author s writing to provide a template where the reader s imagination and or past experience flourish angelopoulos drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the leisurely pacing the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity reverting to the non verbal language of gestures gazes sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so far the music by angelopoulos long time collaborator eleni karaindrou provides more than just a discreet background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light angelopoulos presents us with an other greece one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas drowned in an eternal sunshine here the skies are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled dirty snow of the village streets angelopoulos genius through arvanitis camera is on display throughout the film the suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the albanian border the refugees political or other outcast by the rest of humanity wait they may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper ancestral borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races although angelopoulos political views are well known the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees plights in the process angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical cultural political and personal borders angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions in this film he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus travel alexander is a telemachus in search of a story about an aging greek politician odysseus who disappeared never to be heard of again this political man a brilliant orator unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence his wife and his brilliant career to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world of course the politician is not alexander s father but the politician stands before alexander like a father figure odysseus as with homer s telemachus alexander grows as a person during his odyssey of course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer s odyssey in a contemporary context angelopoulos draws on odysseus s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film in angelopoulos ending odysseus is more like the dante s odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on carrying a suitcase and alexander telemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else he states as much in a voice over at the beginning of the film paraphrasing few lines from dante s inferno and don t forget that the time for a voyage has come again the wind blows your eyes far away finally although angelopoulos is not a religious person there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow suited linesmen who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications and also the christ like figure of the politician in the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography s influence in angelopoulos work they appear like stylites religious figures found in the orthodox tradition solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars in a form of asceticism the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni angelopoulos does not give us any clues and the wife s statement it s not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician but that he could be the politician but the film still ends on an optimistic note whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus communications across the border are still not possible and it remains impenetrable we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary on this account angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually crumble",

south during the early s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire film the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and self discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebrated spielberg s film however re frames walker s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over sexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words it s the south as seen by a child raised on s tv it s all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walker s novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin beyond walker s hate letter to black men and spielberg s bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielberg s camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celie s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film aren t portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone and so there s a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didn t respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won t run afoul of the dominant white culture a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless",
