defines his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous melodramas sirk s melodramas were as the very word signifies dramas with music the music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screen turned canvas but this ain t life but its representation an imitation of life sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood most notably technicolor to distinguish the artificial from the real thing let s remember that his golden period coincides with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama blackboard jungle rebel without a cause sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else another of sirk s statements summarizes this `you can t reach or touch the real you just see reflections if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen one ends up giving up therefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where there s no difference between real and its false copy nobody can say that the hadley are real people that town ain t real either with those hideous oil pumps all over the place so in this realm the acting is affected the decore is fake the trick is visible everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual connotations of dorothy malone with the oil tower for example sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time `the angles are the director s thoughts the lighting is his philosophy in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows the hadleys house with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way a house that resembles a mausoleum that no party can cheer up as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night sirk s photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director s craft sirk considered himself a `story bender because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose written on the wind is a good example it wouldn t work in any other hands the other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin who was for s comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama their films are full of the machinery of american life advertising tv sets jukeboxes washing machines sport cars vacuum cleaners to depict its emptiness and decay i m inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences the game was played by both sides so it was camp now we regard them as `cult or `bizarre because we are not those spectators anymore that is why todd haynes s homage `far from heaven turns into a pastiche because it reproduces sirk s work nowadays as if nothing happened in between then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly there were always immovable characters rock hudson and lauren bacall here against which he could assemble a series of split ones his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones sirk is interested in too when robert stack flies the plane and `tempts lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them obvious faustian echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river in the sirk s universe the studio often imposed `happy ends have no negative impact in fact they worked just great sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feud it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga i absolutely agree and i m sure the parallel is not incidental both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caan s sonny corleone the action of fighting her sister s male friend is symmetrical the non son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town even details as the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork because both films deal with the subject of power the acquisition of power its manipulation and legacy even kyle hadley s sterility the event that hastens the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power in this case a weakness in sexual power the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane one wouldn t think at first of similarities between welles and sirk s films but there are a good many starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family s fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne rock hudson as charles foster kane was adopted by a tutor having his own father alive amazingly the same actor harry shannon perform both wayne and kane s fathers this detail is cannot be a coincidence written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director some say that this is his best film in my opinion `magnificent obsession `all that heaven allows `there s always tomorrow and `imitation of life are just as good and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end",

before their eyes eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them i mean how could the movie really be bad nobody ll admit it it s a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner but the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what i m writing right now i actually plagiarized their faces obviously lois is only aroused by power she won t even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesn t stop jet liners it can t be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that in the old supermans she had some level of connection with him he wasn t priority number obviously but it strengthened her character that she was torn i bet henry kissinger would have even won this lois over before clark kent and now it s official kryptonite does to superman what eating at mcdonalds does to the avg person superman one he loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way he s human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to highschool students he relates to people who feel different he relates the superman returns superman seems to relate only to superpeople and it seems he s just doing a job when he s saving people there s something about clark that lois likes she s really internally in love with him but can t admit it and when he comes into the picture as superman it throws a kink in the on the rocks love without superman she would ve fallen in love with clark at least that s what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman clark is like a pile of horse maneur to lois literally superman two i just watched it again as a kid i thought i enjoyed the action but now i know it was the story that held me then too watching it over and over again if i saw superman returns as a child i would ve hated it then too i think there is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie it s sick superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile meanwhile lex luther s got something fantastic up his sleeve superman three now there s a three way love story between superman and lana and clark only humanity wins and clark s inner nature beats superman s power because when his supermoral nature is gone and he s superhuman who does human things with his superpowers she sees it s not the power of superman that she s in love with it s not superpowerman but supermortalman that she loves and who s really super and when she tells clark she prefers him to superman he is elated he has made a human connection again he wants to be accepted for who he is not just for his ability to bend steel this is the kind of stuff that s missing from superman returns clark super sneezes to help the kid get a strike humanity again plus it s an ineresting use of superpowers he s not just using straight brute strength he crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving it seems there s nothing at stake in superman returns even in superman three we see the damages caused by the nemesis world domination plot we see suffering we see how it effects pryor and others and people in the middle of it there s no damage esp emotional from lex s plot to sink the us we see a glob of crystal thrown into space superman had to get very creative in the first three supermans in order to stop the plot against him he couldn t just access his superpowers in the first one he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save lois life this was thirty years ago in the second one he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more powerful than but combined with lex s genius and the villains immoral tactics superman s overpowering wasn t enough he had to work one against the other and outsmart them in superman iii again his superpowers weren t enough to win he had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw he couldn t use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression and he found that acid earlier when he couldn t simply use his superpowers to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his superbrains he couldn t carry water so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire now in superman returns he simply lunges the island into outerspace like a night temp for ups he doesn t need to figure anything out he just uses his super strength and lex luther s brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a knife of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face but he just averted his eyes and nose like it wasn t grey poupon he was

        "text": "the majority of stephen king s short stories are little gems with original ideas that don t take a long time to develop basically lean and mean he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages you read em and you re finished before you know you ve begun they re like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonald s fries they taste really good and you know there s not much nutritional value in them re from a literary standpoint they don t say much about the universal human condition but you re still gonna scarf em down just don t be a pig and go for the extra super sized portion and fill up on too much grease too much grease is a metaphor for the prose in king s novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on enough with the pop cultural observations or clever yankee asides get on with the story already he has compiled four books of short story collections i ve read them all from nightshift to the latest everything s eventual and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome sized novels but his short stories never overstay their welcome which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes how in the hell did they the series producers get a green light to turn stories that usually averaged pages into minute episodes i ll tell you how two words stephen king stories with his name on them probably didn t come cheap and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones so what should have been an anthology of mostly or minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial time ka ching i m not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories this review supposes you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented of the four installments so far here s my ten cent assessment from first to worst battleground not a classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog and the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the teleplay who is richard matheson s son the writer of tot knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to hurt s apartment than it should have but i think it fulfilled it s objective umney s last case liked this one primarily because of william h macy s performance i think the writer umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the chandleresque set up was due to get interrupted by the writer s reality so let s get on with it already and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled repartee private dick banter already once the writer umney s family tragedy began to reveal though i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the real life macy s attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation s exciting life the end of the whole mess uh this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes i was ready to scream at the tv ok we get it already the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire we know from ron livingston talking to the camera time is running out for me not fast enough i thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity we know this because he s already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn t steer it out of the path of a tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision so much time was wasted on establishing the uber genius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery the end of the world through unintended idiocy how much do we get to see of the world ending a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she s reporting on and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brother s parents drooling and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world i wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with a whimper indeed crouch end this episode just ticked me off totally i could have lived with the taking forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slap and tickle having lunch and getting a taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossed over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills but it failed miserabley not only wasn t it scary it was practically laughable ooh look a kitty wait it turns oh my god look at it s scary eye uh huh they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but i guess the budget wasn t high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn t and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting those were truly horrifying overall series average so far",

bit so what we have instead is a very tame rated pg barely lukewarm low budget roger corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown gremlins critters wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor little of the logic that made gremlins work so well fantasy logic or not no suspense no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity to make up for it although i m sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script let s face it no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director bettina hirsch in more capable hands munchies could have been entertaining after all it starts out like many great adventure films simon waterman harvey korman and his son paul charles stratton are in peru on an archaeological dig simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations for example he thinks he sees evidence of laser cutting on ancient stonework so they re at machu picchu looking for more evidence of simon s theories when they happen upon a secret chamber inside they quickly find the animal they later dub arnold one of the titular munchies they take arnold back home to their small california desert town simon who thinks that arnold is probably an alien creature has to go off to a colleague s lecture and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen paul and his extremely cute girlfriend cindy nadine van der velde are left in charge of arnold but as they haven t seen each other in a long time they leave arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack meanwhile simon s brother cecil played also by korman in a dual role owner of a successful snack foods company is eager to buy off simon s home and land they re adjacent to his own simon doesn t want to sell so cecil hits upon a scheme to steal arnold things gradually spiral out of control and the munchies who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food begin to overrun the town that reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen the best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town interiors with the exception of cecil s home tend to look like poorly decorated cheap sets and more importantly they tend to show that hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots oddly given the paucity of the production design overall cecil s home is quite a gem imbued as it is in overblown s style down to the smallest details and cecil s stepson dude jon stafford was an amusing counterpoint too bad then that he s out of the film so quickly at any rate korman is a fun actor but he comes across much better here as simon than as cecil unfortunately simon ends up being absent for most of the film cecil who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair is not only the evil capitalist of the film he s one of korman s classic inconsiderate boorish characters that was one of his specialties frequently capitalized on in carol burnett show skits unlike the carol burnett show which tended to succeed because directors clark jones and dave powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos hirsch reins korman in way too far and the cecil character just doesn t work the way it should there are a lot of other director related problems not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film even scenes that should have been shoe ins for amping up the drama such as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the road are put together far too awkwardly to have much affect there are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands where did the munchie in the chamber at machu picchu come from the film s trailer seems to show an answer to this but it was edited out of the final cut a more serious problem is that unlike gremlins there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute cuddly furballs to menacing monsters it just happens further because munchies was kept pg and the violence remains toned down when the creatures are in their monster phase they re never very threatening they re also easily dispatched at least temporarily admittedly the gist of the film isn t suspense horror compelling drama or any of that other stuff but humor it s intended more as a spoof of gremlins and the countless rip offs in its wake the only problem with that is that the film just isn t funny even though i chuckled a couple times a surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clich s too much of the remaining material consists of non sequiturs given bad timing from hirsch it all just falls flat there was potential to make a film that while a spoof was both funny and frightening hilarious and disturbing cheesy and suspenseful all at the same time ala killer klowns from outer space too bad then that munchies comes nowhere near that",

creed and the ominous weapon x program his epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non violent his relationship with creed is so glossed over it s difficult to understand how they have any connection at all we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving the romantic element of the movie between silverfox and wolverine was forced and abrupt we are thrown into a romance so fast that it s over before you can blink an eye having just introduced the character silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later we are left wondering why we should care about this who was she anyway for a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story the romance is surprisingly unexplored it was rushed in simply because it was required oddly enough when wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find sabertooth being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise as for the weapon x program lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure wolverine is up and running eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple surprisingly ma and pa kent aren t alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn is it any wonder what fate awaits them in the previous films and the comic books the main reason that wolverines amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded knowing this was the case did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates as hinted to in x x men united when stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together this film sets up the team fairly well only they don t really do much of anything no disturbing violence no ruthless actions they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen it seems that wolverine wasn t an evil man under stryker at all instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother sabertooth which consequently was the violent agent we all thought wolverine was eventually he just leaves all together no conflict of duality here at all idiotically removing that character conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely they may as well have given him rubber claws there were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the x men trilogy including the introduction of one of the lamest deus ex machinas to ever hit a script magic memory erasing bullets really apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story most were in the film for minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverine fred dukes the blob but not the comic version can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all but a simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him cyclops optic beams which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes adamantium trench coats anyone the gravity defying mutant gambit instead of utilizing his signature cards is made into some sort of crazy acrobat in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverine then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running towards wolverine how he regained consciousness ran away a few blocks climbed up a building then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect the comic book source material the real origin of wolverine is a story worth bringing to the screen it doesn t sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies it is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time began with weapon x by barry windsor smith a much more intense and exciting story this fox film should seriously be forgotten anyone have that magic gun",

that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at clooney s subtle touches in scenes like his one word good bye to andy garcia in ocean s when they just utter each other s name disdainfully terry danny you can pick any number of jack s performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee s film of the same name you can see that there is no finer an actor working today i don t mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel s work but he is definitely the cog of the production i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw emotional and incendiary all at the same time washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor played very reservedly by christopher walken is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita i don t know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the film s entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better i am interested to see how his next film domino turns out i think scott is one of today s under rated directors and with more films like this one his name will surely be elevated to icon status the story has creasy really taking to pita and vis ca versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad he is not around much he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it s not just a friendship between them it is more of a kinship and a deep parental love seems to be present the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead he becomes a literal man on fire it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance denzel s anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita s violation this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind also what is paramount to this film s audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful the perpetrators here feel creasy s wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film man on fire is one the five best films of now that it is out on dvd my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks",

maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy this could be slightly misleading as it is not a hilarious film nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense but it does have light hearted moments much as life itself there are also moments of sadness too it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above and nudity runs throughout the length of film the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal and concentrate on the plot not the copious amount of flesh simon and marcie michael allen and eliza lovell arrive by car at a beach side car park they take their belongings to the beach and while they are walking a voice over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is the rest of the film is an exploration of this framed by one complete day at the beach the basic story is of what happens to simon s love life but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes when they arrive at the beach both simon and marcie appear bored with each other marcie sees them as a romeo and juliet romantic couple simon is just bored with it all next we are introduced to gail bonnie jaye lawrence paula zara collins and jenny jennifer ross they are walking down the beach together discussing gail s chances of finding the perfect man aided by the powers of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother however there are many more interesting people on the beach not all of them attractive and young part of the realism of this film to service the beach s patrons there is a flatulent short sighted ice cream salesperson with a van this is ben gary waddell who is a friend of simon and is also his unofficial counsellor i would think that this character is the main comic element it is hard to say though as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud unless you were intoxicated male and very young maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject as the quality of acting is variable the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap the lack of continuity is a positive boon in fact there is something about this film not the nudity that i find appealing it is hard to define what it is but it could be something to do with its bluntness and downright aussie attitude to carnal matters the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention sometimes it is very good with some stunning static shots and pans of the beach cliffs and a sunset as nudity is a major factor in this film framing is an important aspect of the camera work there is no sense of gratuity in the framing meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on private body parts this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject s personal space and makes the film more tasteful not an easy task given the location for filming maslin beach is neither a skin flick for post pubescent testosterone charged males nor a mills and boon romance for under appreciated women maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre the actors are not attractive in the baywatch sense and are just normal people that you would see on the beach anywhere it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement other than perhaps to naturists apart from the australian accent the filming could have been in any sunny country what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless cinema verite and only australian cinema and other medium sized national cinemas could consider such a rash option at the same time these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity and a flop is not going to damage their reputation too much it is always possible given that maslin beach is now a collector s item that the film might become internationally popular but it is very unlikely during this critique i have been sounding highly negative at times about maslin beach this is not the real position as i found the film very easy to watch i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people and problems the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday and a little low on spectacle this does it no harm in my view and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe and with french film in particular they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes but with the everyday hollywood is in direct opposition to this and rides the crest of the hyper real action drama angst wave the pace too is much faster in hollywood but it is not reality maslin beach is not exactly jacques tati either but it is on the right track even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism equality gender orientation and so on that are of such importance in current cinema i am sure that you will either love or hate this film with little room for a middle ground",

        "text": "what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie unfortunately with disjointed storytelling frustrating plot holes and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever let s start with the good stuff comedy acting and special effects from the get go this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky the opening scene the monster s origin is campy and quick paying homage the the classic environmental disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters the pacing is fast which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action with in the course of minutes you get the why where and how of the beast and are ready for action in this the movie delivers after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his precocious little girl kind grandfather and talented sister aunt and of course the monster the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work the monster it s self looks great alien yet familiar kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you see it s strings even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd slipping on surfaces crushing and eating those in it s path when the monster s path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie s appeal begins to unravel following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity plot lines are introduced then abandoned characters change their position for no apparent reason and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random as for the comedy let me say this i m willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation however as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last years still here i d like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white guy that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny but to me weren t spoiler for example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral everyone is mourning a new character is introduced a brother and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder this competition is at it s core funny two brothers who dislike each other so much they even compete at a funeral it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy this subtle slap stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl end spoiler then come the plot holes there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained or worse are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end finding out an obstacle isn t an obstacle can be a good thing for a character but you d expect some comment to that nature instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti climax when problems just aren t there anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start so i ask you why even bring it up in the first place this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other of course introducing new and greater problems is a time tested story telling tradition but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation not in this movie instead it was as if you get several stories each only explained of the way and in the end the parts never converge to complete the whole again i m willing to accept that a lot of this might be cultural maybe its in korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy maybe it s normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every page but never finishes one maybe it s ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves",

would be a bad film but i know what a truly bad film is after watching greats like children shouldn t play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad solar crisis is bad but it doesn t reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at anyway the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it in order to counter act this imminent threat humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb which the opening describes as the biggest explosive ever into the sun which through some convoluted sci fi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle leaving earth unharmed never mind that what i have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original star trek even with an ensemble cast charlton heston peter boyle and jack palance solar crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity thanks to a plot that starts simple yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on the crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character played by boyle who insists on sabotaging the mission through means that are never explained he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crew s genetically engineered scientist played by female lead annabel schofield why is he sabotaging the mission because by his moronic viewpoint he believes the flare won t happen and that when it doesn t he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market in effect you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginable the film s plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline i could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention but i am sitting here writing this review on microsoft word and i know for a fact that this would take three pages and i would only succeed in losing your interest but then again you would probably get the same effect from watching the film anyway the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue imagine if all that ever happened on the star trek enterprise was that the characters spewed sci fi jargon back and forth at each other yes i know they already do that but imagine if that s all they did and that they used said jargon to set up vague and near nonsensical scenes that produce no excitement tension or interest in the viewer whatsoever this is best exemplified at the point when a character in a zero g environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding the script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion but doesn t bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs nor why he can t really escape in totality you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable then we have several scenes where dramatic build up leads to nothing jack palance s performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero don t ask around the desert before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits on his death bed palance finally tells our boy hero his last name while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball which he kept quiet about before colonel travis j richards the boy repeats it quietly after he expires giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film perhaps charlton heston s grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated something anything nope sorry any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic failed attempts at creating drama for a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on palance s career just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villain s spell a climax which features another of the film s considerably well done visual effects sequences that even for the visibly elaborate care put into them still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is the saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind boyle heston and palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure over acting grade

        "text": "i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv long before a live action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson s eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away and isn t that just par for the course i had the chance to revisit this film and found that it still stands up quite well although it s not quite the success that memory had painted i have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson lovers others as jackson haters i m not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note perfect for the radio three years later i must say however that where i found jackson s films an increasingly indulgent disappointment the bakshi version for all that it has been cut to the bone is actually more accurate yes there are the usual understandable changes here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action the only exception to the latter as others have remarked is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell where the ringwraiths having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid flight which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop which is initially nightmarish but pointless plot wise and definitely goes on too long i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory due partly to bad animation and that gandalf windmills his arms too much but having watched both approaches to the film i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is half myth oddly enough one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn s story of beren and luthien the extreme literalism required by live action filming where everything from monsters to mail shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera is counter productive latex faced or cgi monsters are less monstrous than sketchily drawn shapes heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies and hobbits or dwarfs with non human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods with its crippled half human movements as one of the scariest moments in the film it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark the extreme stylisation of the introduction plus a voice over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back story in a few sentences works very well to depict an almost mythical era and the change to the comic book rusticism of the shire i particularly like the proudfeet corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkien s prose i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes bilbo seeming to become a gollum like creature under the influence of ring lust at rivendell and galadriel s famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits changed perceptions but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette firelight hues at bree bright colours re emerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes where a live action approach simply doesn t allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting as a fan i didn t care for either jackson s or bakshi s depiction of lothlorien again i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation i ve come across of a beautiful slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria aragorn giving a hobbit fencing lesson here is as charming and equally uncanonical a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson version the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film viggo mortensen s scruffy jesus look really didn t work for me although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to clean up the character in the second half for gondor s benefit john hurt unsurprisingly gives a sterling vocal performance as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf the hobbits are i suspect intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience identification figures i find the animated style their proportions are much more cartoonish than those of the human characters works well to differentiate them and the whole hairy feet thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions including much fan art personally i have less objection to boromir as viking he was always a fairly bludgeoning type than to beardy aragorn illogical they were both numenorians after all although i am clearly in a minority here the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project with a bizarre tacked on voice over ending attempting to resolve matters a pity it would have been interesting not to mention less frustrating to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith never mind the dead",

firstly the acting of the on screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson s lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really silly save for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jackson s party even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the bakshi s lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority aragorn the lord and with a seasoned rasp aragorn the ranger this is due to john hurt s brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensen s rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven hurt beats mortensen hands down and then there is gandalf probably the most dominating and the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalf william squire is a real wizard and by that i don t mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips he does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellen s gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword as he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while i m sad to say this the great christopher lee didn t bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson s pretendeous bad guys bakshi s orcs taunt their enemies or each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldn t do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky but as much i like this film more than jackson s the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters all hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i don t really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just don t fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humans riders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownish green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing time with limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesn t do it in extensive detail compared to jackson s version in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior overall atmosphere it feels more like middle earth overall voice acting music i really dig the fantasy score by kont rosenman gandalf aragorn one of the john hurt s finest roles king theoden orcs black riders elrond he s not some fairy hippie in this one while jackson version is better because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects gollum smeagol balrog hobbits lord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with it s well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien s fantasy world very well if not perfectly i ll give it a score of out of",

beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films he does not receive th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience if it were not for mr bakshi i don t believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught what is more with the lord of the rings he has not only created a beautiful animated film but he has created an entirely new art form unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm no this is not disney animation no it s not live action no it s not cheating what it is is a new fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as the lord of the rings bakshi s pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way in particular the darker of tolkien s creatures particularly the nazgul are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish peter s beagle s screenplay based very little as i understand it on an early draft by chris conkling is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien s works where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and into a single hour minute film but there are very few changes to the storyline there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled the reforging of narsil the gifts of galadriel the huorns at the battle of the hornburg but again with the time limitations he had already the longest animated feature in history these are certainly understandable though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel also there is the delightful one of my favorites score by leonard rosenman who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work it is bombastic and audacious and dare i say perfect it stands on it s own as an orchestral triumph but when coupled with the images of the film it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off the voice actors are wonderful of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider the character design is also wonderfully unique though not often to everyone s taste but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he she imagines not what you might have imagined and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb this is perhaps not what you imagined but i can only applaud mr bakshi for showing us what he saw it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film one farther word the flight to the ford sequence in my opinion is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build bakshi s artistic ability and tolkien s incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled the recent dvd release by warner brothers is sorely lacking while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format the package is woefully short of extras how glorious it would have been to have had a director s commentary been able to see the minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score of course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made we will never be able to see bakshi s interpretation of gondor of shelob of faramir of the cracks of doom of eowyn s battle with the witch king or gandalf s confrontation with him we will never be graced with bakshi s image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead it is a shame beyond all shames that we will in the end have to accept peter jackson s glitz and glitter hollywood action film version of these later events in tolkien s masterpiece but i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all david",

alternative release horror i love s hacker horror i love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased murdered and eaten by psychopaths i am all for the idea of non professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one i am all for using found public locations non actors no name talent behind the camera and in the studio no problem the most evocative image from the forest is it s opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods we see them as tiny vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator then the film takes a dive never recovers we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked they get separated both are butchered and then we meet the movie s protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam they meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks this film is too slow this movie is too boring and this movie is too talky which wouldn t be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid asinine and unnecessary things you know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopy faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the cannibal woods and speaking of these woods they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it there are impressive shots of the forest primeval but no real sense of being out in the middle of it if any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by what is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest i don t know who these couples are and don t care what happens to them the hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend who just happens to seek shelter in his cave the irony of which is the epitome of underwhelming coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow people s movements a lack of appreciable gore nudity lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that isn t even as frightening as a pbs educational tv show about how magnets work i don t mean to dish it out to the people behind this film since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife there is nothing wrong with that concept what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the minute mark the best thing that you can say about the forest is that it is over relatively quickly and there isn t much to command a repeat screening hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a dvd release it was fine as a prism video rental years oddity as a dvd it will be rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves there is little or no urgency to see the film unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there here is a guide of steps to avoid making with all that said and done the film did have one interesting sequence or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut dried film the madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor he dispatches his beloved arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper the guy corners and attacks his quarry who sidesteps runs away only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger badder weapon the psycho attacks again and the guy gets away the psycho materializes again and once more the guy gets away then again finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption how did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that is there some supernatural element to this psycho since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma staged to build some tension it s purpose remains unclear the whole film is like that really existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham fisted uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on dvd that doesn t mean you necessarily should",

        "text": "i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional especially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealed i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die don t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett s name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys can t stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda s death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wan s death okay but yoda s not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not heroes against a legion of stormtroopers don t believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando s base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star the last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father s face because it made it complete by annakin s revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact that s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke s father isn t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet on another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure let s see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was i am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately",

purse cocked for the bad guys she climbs all the way up the scale to a having been gang raped along with her younger sister some years ago locke as jennifer spencer has tried to block out the attack from her life as best she can her sister tho is almost comatose as a result of the trauma so the memory is never far from her mind one day jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s f she buys a pistol follows him to a bar lets him pick her up then when they re alone in his cadillac beginning to make love she shoots him once in the genitals once in the brain this in the opening scene ya gotta love this spunky lady she s got her priorities straight plus jennifer is a professional artist putting all her anger on canvas until now after executing her first perp jennifer curiously watches det insp harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy then she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street visits her sister in a nursing home then goes a hunting in san paolo ca up the coast where the rape event took place years ago with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist not uncommon to us right wingers when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal don t be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers once in the genitals once in the brain throughout the movie scenes of jennifer s revenge are interspersed with good il dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop remember go ahead make my day later on he threatens to step on a punk kid who d just insulted callahan in a courthouse elevator like he d step on dog s t leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say i want to have your baby my favorite scene is only about minutes into the action when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter s wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel michael grazzo pantangeli in godfather ii does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don even if he s only in one scene dying in a most convincing manner however harry s troubles aren t over with yet the elevator punk s gang and threlkis henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close ordered scenes and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly yup some of the gun play comes off as uninspired screen violence looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie but there s only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets the punk kids die much more creatively though as they both burn to death and drown in s f bay warms my heart with so much violent intent directed at insp callahan his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the caliber vasectomy killing as jennifer spencer s crime is now known but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons to the chowder headed liberals love that harry while our hero up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo two more murders happen same m o on a sleazy lazy fisherman and on an equally creepy hardware entrepreneur then harry meets jennifer they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order making the guilty pay etc could a hot love scene be in the offing soon we re led to believe just that characters abound in this real man meets real woman crime drama and we get to meet a brassy bull dyke named raye parkins who s both irritating and entertaining raye set up jennifer s rape for her boyfriend years before and she ll get hers eventually the san paolo police chief played by reliable eastwood co star pat hingle the hanging judge in hang em high is strangely at odds with callahan s detective work related to the cal vasectomies until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists much like jennifer s sister chief janning s son is now a comatose adult but driven mad by guilt it can t end here though the dyke s rapist boyfriend mick now a kinky sex jerk of a criminal drives in from vegas becuz raye s dropped a dime on jennifer summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions mick sleeps at raye s house but his timing is all wrong and he s arrested before he can spend more time with raye mostly due to the fact that she s since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer s revolver psycho mick makes bail at long last with jennifer gunning for him a desperate chase ensues as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other it all turns out well in the end with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song",

        "text": "this final entry in george lucas s star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series on the contrary sure it s not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow going at times but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission the first third of the movie where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt is a classic jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba s court including the intimidating slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while things get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i ve read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga i don t totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should however their leader wicket played by warrick davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the imperial troops technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrast by the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire s all new half completed death star and luke s final showdown with darth vader and the emperor the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance also as iconic as james earl jones voice as darth vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled crone like emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably shouldn t be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence the acting is classic star wars fare hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c po frank oz s yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it and yes there s also john williams music all told while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever in george lucas re released the classic star wars in digitally restored and revamped special editions which featured added in effects and or shots as well as some enhancements of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out of place albeit funny if you re not so easily offended jedi rocks musical number in jabba s palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film however i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy this dvd version features yet more tweaking we get to see more montage finale scenes notably on naboo where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming wesa free and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone however if you re watching the star wars saga chronologically and contemplating about it chances are you may react a little differently nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it s probably best to be warned beforehand as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga as lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent the original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance",

of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan as played by clint eastwood so popular he carries a badge and works within the law but at heart harry is a vigilante meting out justice `his way which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors as well as the criminals he s pursuing but it s what draws the audience anyone who s ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it even if it s only on the screen and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done and quickly is one of the elements that makes `sudden impact directed by and starring eastwood so successful in this one the fourth of the series while working a homicide harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own with one exception whoever it is he s definitely not carrying a badge in his own inimitable way inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time so he does as only `dirty harry can in a small town north of san francisco harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m o employed by the perpetrator unaccountably harry encounters resistance from the local police chief jannings pat hingle who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere not one to be deterred however harry continues his investigation which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist jennifer spencer sondra locke gradually harry discovers a link between the victims the burning question though is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture eastwood is in top form here both in front of and behind the camera and it is arguably the second best of the five film series right behind the original `dirty harry it had been seven years since the last `harry offering `the enforcer but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director s chair as he is able to recapture the essence of not only his own character but that `spirit that made these films so successful and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between s and as with all the films he directs eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end the screenplay by joseph stinson is well written and formulated to that distinctive `dirty harry style the dialogue is snappy and the story itself conceived by charles b pierce and earl e smith is the most engaging since the original `dirty harry as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama rather than entirely upon the action the characters are well drawn and convincing and of course this is the film that gave us one of harry s best catch phrases `go ahead make my day as harry clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular he lives by a personal moral code a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear possibly more so today than ever before no matter who we are or where we come from there s undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry or at least have him around `dirty harry is an icon of the cinema and it s impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him for better or worse eastwood `is dirty harry without question just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone sherlock holmes sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer a young woman wronged and out for vengeance or as she sees it `justice she manages to bring a hard edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character with a convincing introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action genre even amid the violence locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood s harry and becomes in philosophy and deed something of his counterpart in supporting roles two performances stand out paul drake as mick creates the best `psycho since andy robinson s dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `dirty harry with actually very limited screen time drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience this is the guy you can t wait to see harry take care of in the end also effective is audrie j neenan who makes her character ray parkins the epitome of the proverbial `low life who can be found in any bar in any city it s a performance that evokes a gut level response and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism the supporting cast includes albert popwell horace mark kevloun bennett and nancy parsons mrs kruger with a perfect blend of drama and action `sudden impact dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality the perfect justice of a not so perfect world that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience",

spotlight off the original star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi often derided for its overly cute factor rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back indeed the cute element of rotj namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities only he can answer that question this cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo harrison ford the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben obi wan kenobi alec guiness to fight the evil empire now swathed all in black luke s discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor s side early scenes in tatooine are impressive from jabba s lair to his floating palace and the almighty sarlac an intenstine that lives in the sand lucas cgi enhancements to the film in actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdone the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time the viewer is let down by yoda s distinct lack of screentime undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke s destiny is played out on screen rotj really is luke s film perhaps even more so than the original his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow the romance between leia carrie fisher and solo is all but non existant unlike in empire in fact only leia s character is developed in rotj solo s character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace darth vader the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin peter cushing from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his character s progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series ford s role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films he was the real star of the first film after all fisher s leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c po and r d and the series resembles a family more than a cast despite the film s corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on endor in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects the music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance just as the blue danube worked perfectly for a space odyssey john williams score is as much a part of star wars folklore as light sabers and the force lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made indeed sci fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii viii and ix in their heads over and over again rotj works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series when all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made is it already the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly years after its release",

        "text": "after reading the previous comments i m just glad that i wasn t the only person left confused especially by the last minutes john carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him i anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior naturally i assumed he had something to do with the evil goings on at the house but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse hereafter referred to as zombie these scenes made absolutely no sense please if someone out there knows why carradine kept climbing down into graves let the rest of us in on it all the action is confined to the last minutes so i ll attempt a synopsis john carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate and is throttled by zombie so far so good but then we get the confusing scene where john ireland and jerry strickler out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard discover carradine s dead body strickler repeatedly tries to push ireland into the open grave from whence zombie had emerged but ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead and presto strickler comes out as zombie yeah i guess we can infer that strickler was dead all along a witch but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting flesh version by flying into zombie s grave is never explained considering how excruciatingly slow moving these zombies are i d of thought he would have preferred to stay in his normal form until his business was concluded this scene also brings a question to mind just who the heck is zombie we can only assume zombie is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie s opening credits but who knows which one nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew anyway after ireland sees this transformation and runs away we see the exact same shot of zombie shambling through the trees as we saw for zombie this leads to momentary confusion over just how many zombies there really are then in best s horror movie fashion ireland manages to trip while fleeing he conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of faith domergue s dead cat wasn t that nice of john carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew meanwhile zombie has been wrecking havoc up at the house he easily dispatches three film crew members then starts up the stairs faith domergue hears him and thinking it s lover john ireland back from his night shoot goes out upon seeing it s only zombie she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves ireland s revolver while starlet carole wells is showering at this point and can t hear the scream her co star charles macauley who s boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom does taking his sweet time and only after some more swigs from his hip flask he finally decides to investigate one thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how slow to react the stars are to screams and gunshots domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready but mistakes macauley for zombie and shoots him six times he does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing then a horrified domergue backs up right into the waiting arms of zombie carole wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and domergue s screams she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate so during this time zombie has time to string domergue up from the neck with a rope wells sees domergue s hanging corpse and faints dead away the next time we see her is in a stream outside the house but more on that later meantime ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers zombie s bloody carnage though ireland has just stumbled upon murdered people he s more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined mercifully for him and the audience zombie throws some movie equipment down on his head from the nd floor that s the last we see of zombie at this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths showing that the new ones mirror the old ones how profound zombie meanwhile has gotten near the house remember these zombies move as slow as molasses in january where he happens to see carole wells floating by in a stream and fishes her out how did she get there did zombie carry her down throw her in then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush john ireland apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub so wells has to drown too but why outside in a stream instead of in the tub is never explained zombie never makes it into the house himself everyone s dead by now anyways thanks to zombie but instead he carries carol wells back to the graveyard as the end credits flash on screen we see zombie with his dead love still in his arms descending into the open grave the viewer is left wondering yes but wasn t this zombie s grave why is zombie taking up residence and what if zombie comes along and wants to climb back in is zombie gonna let him or will there be a zombie fight will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased carole wells and what about now dead john carradine where s he gonna stay after all from the earlier scenes we know he s clearly at home in the grave if this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused don t worry cause you re not alone",

berlin classic movies like das cabinet des dr caligari and nosferatu eine symphonie des grauens were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn t have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener director of s der golem wie er in die welt kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally another horror film der student von prag der student von prag the student of prague is the story of balduin paul wegener a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague but who always find himself with financial troubles one day balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit grete berger from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he ll have to compete with her rich cousin graf von schwarzenberg lothar k rner who also wants to marry her knowing that he can t offer her much balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli john gottowt enters the scene scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror loosely inspired by edgar allan poe s short story william wilson and the classic legend of faust the story of der student von prag was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form der student von prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the scriptwriters of his time ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although der student von prag begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin while der student von prag was paul wegener s directorial debut and stellan rye s second film as a filmmaker it s very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to guido seeber s cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his golem series from seeber and rye despite having very limited resources rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with balduin s reflection played by wegener too already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers as balduin paul wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can t deny that wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract john gottowt plays the sinister scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove few is said about scapinelli in the film but gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared the rest of the main cast is less lucky with grete berger being pretty much average as countess margit and lothar k rner making a poor graf von schwarzenberg however it must be said that lyda salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and fritz weidemann made an excellent baron waldis schwarzenberg showing the dignity that l rner s character should have had considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made years after this film is superior in every possible way it s not difficult to understand why der student von prag hasn t stood the test of time as well as other early films the movie s main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what ewers story needed to be fully developed this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course there s also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete however der student von prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history as the direct predecessor of the german expressionist movement it s hard to deny the enormous importance that der student von prag has in the history of german cinema probably in the history of cinema in general it may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it s truly better than most films from that era as the movie that started paul wegener s career and with that german expressionism der student von prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history",

highly entertaining and taken in the right context as a work of fiction it is a very good movie for that i give it the two stars however rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character dr nicholas garrigan is a complete invention of fiction rather it presents this character into a real historical setting and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real and what they are seeing is the truth i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction but to do so in such a dishonest matter is in a word reprehensible there can be no doubt that africa along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film but hollywood also has its eye toward making money the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much at the end of the day they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming see we told you it was bad the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin idi s second wife whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity in the film we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse arms for legs and vice versa this is the director making sure you understand that amin is as the gungans say bom bad but watching the documentary we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true so what they just make up these things why because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence that s why they don t trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves look that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media we don t need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that and this is just the tip of the iceberg what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin s wing as such garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world the producers seem to thing we won t be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it ironically even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons making several horrible mistakes and then redeeming himself even at the cost of three other innocent lives honestly i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind ron howard and akiva goldsman s sugary sweet adaptation of the life of john nash which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can t get enough of the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years and viewers who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves buy these fake portraits hook line and sinker look i m certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he wasn t my point is with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films why can they not trust us to think for ourselves can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves i urge all who continue to watch hollywood s purportedly true movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth",

that it introduces and then leaves its hero fillion to follow grant grant michael rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags michael rooker s character isn t that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster s interest might be interesting if this was grant portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horror comedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movie s problems are in the script it isn t that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates the purpose of a horror comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the alien s habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the ostensible heroine elizabeth banks as starla grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the end when fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows and the characters should know that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act accordingly shotguns instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing spoilers ahead after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writer director gunn chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien s plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor my last criticism is based on the movie s look gunn is primarily a writer or maybe it was budgetary constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office mojo states the films budget was million newspapers say million and considering they didn t use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadly the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character s actions by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grant the alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and act although this movie is ostensibly a horror comedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be anathema preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither",

        "text": "many neglect that this isn t just a classic due to the fact that it s the first d game or even the first shoot em up it s also one of the first stealth games one of the only and definitely the first truly claustrophobic games and just a pretty well rounded gaming experience in general with graphics that are terribly dated today the game thrusts you into the role of b j don t even think i m going to attempt spelling his last name an american p o w caught in an underground bunker you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes but let s face it most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders the graphics are as i mentioned before quite dated and very simple the least detailed of basically any d game released by a professional team of creators if you can get over that however and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you then you ve got one heck of a good shooter sneaking game the game play consists of searching for keys health and ammo blasting enemies aforementioned nazis and a boss enemy per chapter of varying difficulty which of course grows as you move further in the game unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms there is a bonus count after each level is beaten it goes by how fast you were basically if you beat the par time which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level this can be quite fun to try and beat and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in they are even challenging after many play throughs how much nazi gold treasure you collected and how many bad guys you killed basically if you got of any of aforementioned you get a bonus helping you reach the coveted high score placings the game mostly but not always allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see you can either run or walk and amongst your weapons is also a knife running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard as is gunshots many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them nearly silently in your inventory you can get no less than four weapons and two keys more about the weapons later the keys unlock certain doors most doors in the game aren t locked only two kinds need keys and these keys are only introduced in later levels you restart in levels resetting weaponry health score and lives in each chapter much of the later game is spent looking for them now as i just alluded to this game like many of the period late s early s is based on collecting extra lives personally i think it s completely and utterly useless it was mercifully dropped from here on end i think from the next d shooter and onwards since you can save anytime you want and using a life resets weaponry health and ammo like starting on a new chapter which is a real pain in later levels where you need heavier artillery now i shall beat around the bush no longer moving on to the guns you start with aforementioned knife which is silent but only effective up close and a pistol nothing special but good for conserving ammo unlike the next two bad boys your third weapon is a german smg a sub machine gun it s faster and automatic and some later enemies use it and the last one is nothing short of a gatling gun oh yeah think t think predator think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun it s every bit as entertaining as it sounds most of the boss enemies use this though so be prepared i won t reveal the identities of these boss enemies however that s for each player to discover for him or her self the sound is excellent very crisp and realistic as you hear the tear of a machine gun firing the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german you truly feel like you are there trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems that segues me nicely into the level design as you run through seemingly countless nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood i almost got motion sickness more than once though that might also have something to do with little sleep lots of humidity and unusual warmth from playing though the level of detail isn t terribly high what there is is great remains of victims guards quarters and countless nazi symbols the list goes on the game also features quite a bit of gore for it s limited graphics engine john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game what is there left to say the first of its kind and it s no wonder this spawned countless others d shooters sure weapon bobbing and different height levels stairs and such didn t come around until the next entry into the genre doom and it was duke nukem d that introduced the feature of switching your view so it goes beyond simply left and right adding vertical dimensions to it and jumping didn t come around until a third later title the first quake possibly fellow gamers help me out here but all of those games as well as the rest of the genre owe their existence to this one so load up the luger open the door to enter the bunker and step into b j s shoes he deserves the recognition even or maybe even especially nearly fifteen years after he first appeared i recommended this to all fans of d games",

talk this is the film for you repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices wow thank you idris muhammed this film is pretentious but while much of the pontificating from youssou n dour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates the music saves the day the main idea behind the film what i take to be the main idea dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting to gather a group of musicians from america and europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery back to their roots in the music of west africa and a concert in the old slave fort of gor e off the coast of senegal we are treated to gospel blues jazz and variations of these including some fantastic drumming both in new orleans and senegal there s also a good deal of n dour s own compositions sadly that s another weakness it s never entirely clear what n dour himself wants to achieve to some degree the film appears to be an exercise in self promotion on n dour s part he wants to play his own music jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires he s clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the curator of the gor e museum the clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places for example somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir but n dour and most of his mates are moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film the whole early sequence involving the black christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black christians who can hold a tone turn up in dakar at the end of the film to be fair they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film if the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel why not also in the direction of latin america where are the black musical influences from the caribbean and brazil samba reggae then there s europe here the black diaspora doesn t seem to have produced any musicians of calibre since n dour chooses to draft in austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from luxemburg are they in the team just because n dour has played with him before what i personally found most irritating though was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of s beatnik black power nation of islam cultural happening in the new york home of amir baraka a k a leroi jones hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance why do so many african americans believe that taking an arabic name is an assertion of their african roots and why do they think arabic islam is so much more admirable than european christianity who do they think established the trade in african slaves in the first place the film doesn t have much to say about the situation in west africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for years the senegalese appear to be a poor but happy musical gifted folk friendly and welcoming respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting americans in the fish market is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination there is no comment on the armed guard that n dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of dakar there is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from dakar came from dakar the similarity between the folk drumming style of new orleans and the folk drumming style of senegal is cited in evidence the last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland bidding them farewell except of course that by and large the slaves shipped from dakar did not come from dakar they were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever european power currently held the gor e slave fort the people of dakar are not the descendents of africans who escaped the slave trade they are just as likely more likely to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile the two agenda s clash again in the final part of the film there are two separate endings on the one hand the concert which n dour and co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the gor e slave fort the other end comes when the harmony harmoneers sing the spiritual return to glory in the seaward doorway of the slave fort this is deeply moving even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears this is a film that is flawed unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions irritating confusing beautiful and emotional by turns watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling but don t expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour",

than clones it wasn t particularly memorable or satisfying i was years old when i saw star wars i still remember sitting in the theater from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience i ll never forget a timeless story of the bored farm boy who just knows he was meant for more saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard the rogue pirate and the various comic relief all in a space opera setting and that s not to chastise lucas for using an old formula it s an old formula precisely because it works and to his credit he gave it new twists that made it very special then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time the great villain vader was luke s father wow no one saw that coming of course i m convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay go back and watch star wars again knowing what you know now particularly in light of the first three episodes see if it really meshes which brings me to the problem i have revenge is an entertaining movie tremendous effects plenty of action some good fighting scenes but a movie still lives or dies on its plot the story it is telling oh certainly really good acting can save a weak plot but a weak plot coupled with bad acting that s a burden no director can overcome certainly not one as bad as i m forced to realize george lucas is the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors liam neeson natalie portman samuel jackson spoilers ahead the plot oh my understand he s already handicapped by what s happened in the first two films so it s an incredible burden one too much for him to overcome first we have the sheer absurdities of the background we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine the product of a virginal miracle birth the chosen one well this detail never gets remotely explained indeed the closest explanation is yoda s observation that maybe they were wrong oh well okay then our mistake now this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c po hey what a coincidence that is and he ll come back to tatooine and never know he was from there wow how about that testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there eh george anyway we have this bratty kid moody petulant whining young adult who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history the great tragedy of darth vador the good guy who falls from grace only to finally achieve redemption in the end how pray tell does this happen why he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth now sure he lives in a star spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline but does it occur to the dark one to be to maybe check with a physician cause maybe just maybe this futuristic society might can do something about this problem why no the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they ve been chasing for two films tells him that he s got the secret to immortality well of course he does sheesh how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it how can anyone expect us to care hell why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil but because he was pathetically stupid oh by the way amidala finally dies in childbirth why well they don t know the doctor who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced offers only the conclusion of she s lost the will to live well oh okay of course she has maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with but here we are we have kenobi present for all this he knows of the birth of luke and leia knows who their father is and knows what happens to them knows also the role of both r and c po and yet in several years as luke approaches manhood and shows up with po and r curiously po s mind is wiped but not r s why stating i think these droids belong to you kenobi who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be the chosen one and apprentice to the emperor himself and who just happened to be built on this very planet says strange i don t recall owning any droids oh good grief lucas simply made this up as he went along once he introduced vader as luke s father sadly the story began spinning out of control because he didn t know what the story was the plot of episodes is simply incomprehensible nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars it s an afterthought and it looks it i can t give this movie a high rating it reminds me of triple x a fun film to watch but entirely forgettable star wars will stand in my mind forever thankfully this one and the two preceding it will soon fade",

glamorizes violence but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first but shows the bad side by the end of the movie which is far worse than the good side is good david duchovny plays brian kessler an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for i don t know where places where nudity passes for art maybe it really does and i just don t understand it at any rate brian and carrie duchovny and michelle forbes who fits the role flawlessly make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites brian the writer will write the book carrie can take the pictures being artistic types brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses and are contacted by early grace and adele corners brad pitt and juliette lewis early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer sees the ad on a bulletin board and decides to leave the state for a while violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord s murder so he won t have to deal with a pesky murder investigation two birds with one stone you know the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash without resorting to clich s or even ending up with caricatures of either type brian and carrie are artsy liberals but while carrie catches on to early and adele brian is fascinated with early s status as an outlaw as seen in the scene where brian shoots early s gun never having fired a gun before he s as fascinated as a little kid while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early broke her of smoking and that she s not allowed to drink early doesn t think women should early and brian are out at the local bar brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy hit him bri it s comin this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie partly because it s so funny what early gleefully says as the guy s friends drag him away bloodied and battered but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel we learn so much all at once about the two couples their differences and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them and besides that because brian benefited from early s actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele clearly by now you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer but on the other hand it s a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes while studying the actions of past murderers brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it s in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past i am constantly amazed at brad pitt s versatility as an actor consider for example his roles in movies like kalifornia monkeys fight club and ocean s and pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character and is completely believable incidentally i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year but just couldn t get the hair and beard right i even got the hat right which initially i thought would be the hardest part it s easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience s understanding of its subject matter a film that didn t glorify violence at least initially could never be as effective as kalifornia but the movie structures it perfectly the glorification is all embodied in brian s and carrie s fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened but their realization and ours is embodied in the real thing which they encounter with early and adele the movie s very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real",

was it the first match on the card i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets mvp s ass on fire as they re on the apron and then mvp is running around the arena while yelling eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as mvp sprawls around the entrance ramp funny and visually quite entertaining ending wwe tag team championship this was originally supposed to be william regal dave taylor vs brian kendrick paul london c in a regular tag team match however gm teddy long comes to the ring and announces that it s going to be a fatal way tag team ladder match mnm and the hardys are thrown in and it s all chaos one word to describe this eye opener wow man i really can t remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can t really do it justice there was one particularly notable spot where the hardys set up a ladder in a see saw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held mnm for the kill and then wham nitro blew away while mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face he had to be taken away and nitro continued the match alone another spot was when jeff powerbombed london while flipping off the ladder there were other high flying breathtaking spots too many to remember london finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show stealer the boogeyman vs the miz the two men get thrown in and around the ring until boogeyman explodes a sit out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over the miz s mouth as usual for this three minute incognito united states championship chris benoit c faces off chavo guerrero in yet another typical guerrero match some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by chavo and an unusually long chain of german suplexes by benoit vicki guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a sharpshooter or not this allows chavo to go for a roll up but benoit rolls it up once more and chavo is locked in the sharpshooter game over nice hard fought battle albeit slow at times wwe cruiserweight championship gregory helms c vs jimmy wang yang for this one in a fairly moderate paced match the match had some good high flying spots most notably helms moves off the top rope but the crowd didn t seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match and yang needs to get more airborne helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee the undertaker vs mr kennedy in a last ride match after a series of matches between these two this time it is a last ride match the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse pretty good indeed for what these two could offer kennedy manhandled a good deal of taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw taker off the armageddon set about feet below and thank god for kennedy otherwise it would ve been brutal kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the hearse i liked the camera view inside the hearse taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on kennedy and broke the hearse s window instead but then later busted kennedy open with a chair and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and tombstone on the hearse s roof kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the arena to win i actually found myself really interested into these guys willingness to take give real sick shots santa comes into the ring i go what the hell like many of the kids in the crowd and then the word lingerie contest gets in my ear break time batista john cena vs finlay king booker talk about charisma vs technicality this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense even finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time i kind of doubted his strength against the champs and him and booker mainly didn t succeed in trying to cheat except at one point where booker rammed his scepter into cena s throat batista hits the bomb on booker for the win didn t get to see the f u cena performed the knuckle shuffle anyhow and i think he also did the stfu this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder being an on and off wwe fan i have to agree that armageddon was laced up with numerous eye catchers throughout and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show the last ride match featured some fairly nerve wrenching spots and the main event also did very well for its category all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs the miz bout and the ever useless lingerie contest overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay per view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the ppv chronology armageddon wishes this year s goodbye respectably ppv rating",

        "text": "wwe has produced some of the worst pay per views in its history over the past few months cyber sunday survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show smackdown to attempt to end the year on a high note armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay however it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present t lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyz i am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for mercury he didn t get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercury s night early we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not for the faint of heart the ending to this roller coaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory i have been watching wrestling for almost years and it doesn t get any better than this match unbelievable the night opened with only the th ever inferno match kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown to johnny cash s ring of fire the other gimmick match of the night and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used poles chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd didn t pop for this the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match winning tombstone in other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match this was a very good bout with benoit hitting german suplexes on chavo at one time benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission another cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe gregory helms and jimmy wang yang featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns resident redneck the boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match i hate the boogeyman with a passion only worth listening too for jbl s ranting about miz jbl is comedy gold the last match of the night was main event number world heavyweight champion batista and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions king booker there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabomb so is over for the wwe in regards to it s pay per view schedule it started the year on a terrible note with new year s revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match",

        "text": "such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar s a bug s life we re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when it s in the right hands that is a bug s life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions it is only pixar s second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film after all it s a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug s life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you ll probably ever encounter not only are they all entirely amiable and likable there isn t an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters but they re colourful they re eclectic and they re idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug s life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season s harvest with his antics the problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack s hands however it s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in flik s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony s rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers if you think about it a bug s life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line s of akira kurosawa s classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bug s life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively as i ve said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bug s life even better is that the film isn t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clich d kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we d like however it s easy to ignore this fault and it s incredulously easy to enjoy this film although a bug s life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they re not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it s only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bug s life other than see it it s not quite the best which we ve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year and i ll be damned if this isn t the best animated feature of",

        "text": "i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of s films if was the year of the biographies and was the year of the political films can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows you re dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller it s one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly masterson s screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay but the film has much more going for it than just it s delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top notch combining the sizzling drama thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell the screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the film s dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it s watching actors and then there s albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they re middle aged men and yet despite this it is clear how finney s father favours hawke s younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters wives of the brothers also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go by this film isn t revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and it s very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson s brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing first time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years",
