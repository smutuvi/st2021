        "text": "the blob qualifies as a cult sci fi film not only because it launched year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the s interestingly nobody in the kay linaker theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous scarlet red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as the blob steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall the old west bounty hunter in wanted dead or alive after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures release meanwhile mcqueen s attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in the andy griffith show as sheriff taylor s school teacher girlfriend helen crump of course neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers director irvin s yeaworth jr made his directorial debut with the blob linaker simonson s screenplay synthesized four genres first the alien invasion second teenage delinquency third a murder mystery and fourth a horror chiller moreover while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes it remains largely anonymous in other words the eponymous jell o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy instead it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody the tone of the blob is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of the blob the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing jane anita corsaut and steve steve mcqueen see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it meanwhile an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick when the old timer olin howland of the paleface gets a closer look at it the goop attaches itself to his hand the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr hallen in town hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation of course hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man s forearm hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve s fast driving steve fools him into a reverse drive race but the local police chief dave earl rowe lets him off the hook steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor after they visit the old man s house and rescue a dog the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr hallen s office during the interim the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer killed hallen s nurse and attacked the doctor neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen s shotgun have any effect on the blob steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident dave is frankly incredulous while sergeant bert john benson believes that it is a prank bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car steve and jane take them to hallen s office but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody but dave admits that the office has been vandalized against sgt bert s advice dave turns the teens over to their respective parents no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again they drive into town and spot the old man s dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket when they go to retrieve the mutt steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens they find nobody inside but they encounter the blob steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn t attack them later after they escape steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store about that time the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers suddenly a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark producer james b harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo the blob proved to be a drive in hit and steve mcqueen s surge to stardom gave the film added momentum unless you are a juvenile this little horror movie isn t scary at all but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination so the blob isn t without a modicum of subtlety",

of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories i was surprised how this film at best woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it s inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl a few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by obligation while we can see the gears under the film so clearly striving to be diverse but falling ever so short the is why everything falls short all characters white plus a few token minorities are one dimensional cardboard cutouts of people concepts worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i d say is a gag we get a basic conceit then some punchline intended to be a clever twist but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say okay that was a surprise the stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending you re writing jokes spoilers below the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories that s fine but romance is amazing deep sometimes complex these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other words exchange thoughts are projected through voice over but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another meaning there is no seduction in the broad sense no tension and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ethan hawke gets outwitted by the girl he s hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we d be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b so it unfolds if something like a postcard could unfold with all the other tales as well a then b that s it the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan by the way the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village it s easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual orientation and so on _new york i love you_ however deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title we expect to see the real new york and real new yorkers but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic its characters flown in from the o c plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity but when we look closer at who those characters are the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent for example the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact he s the father notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic construction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend stepfather are strutting the girl away it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl s father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer what the dad can t be just some guy from south america now that he s obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle to upper class white woman are we that naive as to require such as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable it s not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone but in every conceivable set up and plot twist the direction taken screams status quo appeals to safety all these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the single dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy how bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead again i m not saying the entire conceit has to be changed it s just that every damn story premise is so hackneyed and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york outside the trite the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was well dredge and the general feel of many of the scenes the movie was just fine to sit through and i wouldn t dissuade anyone from doing so however it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non superficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased that s what i love about new york everyone s from a different place well you wouldn t know it from watching this one",

is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released gore vidal s bestseller was a darkly satirical statement most filmmakers felt that the novel s story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry insiders were surprised when th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen but studio executives soon had cold feet vidal s adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves rewrite upon rewrite followed the cast sensing disaster became increasingly combative in her dvd commentary star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra s motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film in the accompanying back story documentary rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself the basics of vidal s story are there but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications it seems to have no point in and of itself everything runs off in multiple directions nothing connects and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce the only laughs generated are accidental chief among these accidents is mae west it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one liner but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling to say the least but worse really is the fact that west is outside her era her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self caricatures ever seen on film the remaining cast is largely wasted raquel welch a significantly underestimated actress plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids non actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron but the entire role is essentially without point only john huston and cameo players john carradine jim backus william hopper and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed yes it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow slow when it should be fast relentlessly unfunny from start to finish it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action but by and large whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one the how and why of that is made clear in sarne s audio commentary sarne did not like the novel or for that matter the subject matter in general he did not want to write the screenplay but he needed the money he emphatically did not want to direct the film but he need the money he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed at one point he flatly states that reed is not a nice person and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their homosexual agenda which when you come right down to it seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal s novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take off on it although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people when taken in tandem with the film itself sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making of documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been printed to black and white the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored but the documentary details what they were the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine but to end where i began this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians movie buffs and cult movie fans i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone but everyone else should pass it by gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer",

making it this film was loathed from day one while every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do it s not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like scarface or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like showgirls undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable myra breckinridge is just plain mean as a hollywood satire it is cold blooded and mean spirited but in a hollow pointless way myra takes for granted that hollywood is a corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as laurel and hardy shirley temple judy garland and gary cooper the film seems to imply that everything about hollywood is by its very nature vile it seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows but doesn t supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place the film is also viscously anti american and anti establishment and anti this and anti that but all in a superficial late s trendy way like casino royale ski doo i love you alice b toklas and other would be hip epics myra is a middle aged vision of the hippy dippy youth culture it tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles but instead of being cheerfully self mocking myra makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp myra breckinridge has the humor of a bully there s not a single moment of innocence in it its intentions aren t honorable time magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as a child molester but it s not nearly as sympathetic for instance poor mae west bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse the octogenarian star obviously didn t know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great grandsons but director michael sarne had to know but he used her anyway why because she apparently was the joke just like john huston john carradine grady sutton andy devine and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images they are cast as smarmy self parodies as is rex reed the arrogant fey film critic who is cast as just that in the film but the real reed the celebrity hound jet setting talk show gossip can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way but as myron myra s alter ego he is just obnoxious again apparently for sarne reed is the joke you watch myra breckinridge and you don t see actors you see victims none more so than raquel welch no one will ever accuse welch of being a great actress but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered being in almost every scene welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives a remarkably nuanced performance though of course centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost catatonic west welch doesn t have to do much to strike a good balance even so she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk with just the hint of self righteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud legend has it that welch was snubbed by a condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance the film s only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film s agenda is the whole story is a fantasy fable which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver but what that might be is anybody s guess with all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind but as a feminist myra is a monstrous figure a sexual predator besides myra isn t a woman rather she is a delusion of myron who presumably is a gay male that might explain the male rape scene as well as the character s love hate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight deadhead rusty but it doesn t explain his her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with farrah fawcett s mary ann the film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and degrading turning to gore vidal s original novel isn t of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the movie and this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies not just movies as a business but movies as part of the culture as well the film itself is wall to wall arcane references to old movies all of which director screenwriter sarne approaches with a seething disdain he has raided the film vaults of th century fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide a social commentary but to mock the innocence of old hollywood how can an artist if you generously want to call sarne that make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in the very effort is totally self defeating myra breckinridge doesn t seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty it hates hollywood it hates america it hates sex it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and well you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it in a very sad and sorry way myra breckinridge may be the first punk manifesto a celebration of pop culture nihilism",

as any hong kong film ever has it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama interesting and sympathetic and also non sympathetic characters some genuinely funny humor and truly over the top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century i think they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love sammo is interested in local baker girl ping nina li chi while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit ying he falls madly in love with many other characters get introduced too and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong soon we get to know for instance that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created as well as some nice drama the film has a great cast the leads are all very good and restrained not as painfully awful over acting and humor as in sammo s otherwise great eastern condors for example and they are also thanks to the carefully written screenplay pretty likable and easy to identify with the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul and ninja in the dragon s den and fong sai yuk and the masterful composer lowell lo koon ting john woo s the killer and ringo lam s school on fire and prison on fire among many others pedicab driver included the shaw veteran liu chia liang whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks alfred cheung kin ting the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from the late great lam ching ying best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror kung fu comedies to name just a few in fact the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i ve seen in any other hk production the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo s character they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love no matter what s your past or what you ve done for living get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner also the other characters efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship and of course love still i think what fennie says to max about the future bad cooking is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively unfortunately but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in which is the action the outrageous and over the top action the fight scenes include traditional kung fu some sticks meat cleavers and the like and they re used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i ve seen in any film ever jackie chan s drunken master ii they really are that great there are wires and they re used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his her breath as the film has one fast car vs pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination still the film makers seem not to accept the violence of the film as sammo is like the late bruce lee willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa and i think this kind of morale no matter how obvious or shallow it may be is a good thing even in a harmless film like this as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i m not sure everyone in hollywood or america for example would understand or like at all the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing also some funny scenes are created out of sammo s passion for ping still the greatest amazement filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction of course pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo s greatest achievements if the few minor flaws were not there this could rate even brighter and higher",

book s title is good enough to stand alone i have not read hickam s memoirs but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation the film directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick records the story of teenager homer hickam jake gyllenhaal beginning in october of it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik the first artificial satellite in orbit we see a images of a blue gray town and its people mostly miners working for the olga coal company one of the miners listens to the news on a hand held radio as he enters the elevator shaft but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness losing sight of the starry sky above him a melancholy violin tune fades with this image we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting october coalwood west virginia homer and his buddies roy lee cook william lee scott and sherman o dell chad lindberg are talking about football tryouts football scholarships are the only way out of the town and working in the mines for these boys why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college questions homer roy lee replies they re also the only ones who get the girls homer doesn t make it in football like his older brother so he is destined for the mines and to follow in his father s footsteps as mine foreman until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky then he wants to build a rocket i want to go into space says homer after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother s natalie canerday fence homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson chris owen quentin asks homer what do you want to know about rockets homer quickly anwers everything his science teacher at big creek high school miss frieda riley laura dern greatly supports homer and the four boys work on building rockets in homer s basement his father however whose life is the mine does not support him john hickam chris cooper believes that homer shouldn t waste his time on the rockets that the coal mines are all that matter the coal from the mines is used to make steel and without steel the country would be nothing the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film miss riley introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship you can t just dream your way out of coalwood she tells homer homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets improving the models with each attempt despite the many attempts the boys do not lose their determination what are the chances of us winning that science fair o dell asks homer in one of their more despairing moments a million to one answers homer that good o dell replies well why didn t you say so the music composed by mark isham conveys sadness and hope at the same time especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood rollicking s rock and roll including songs by the coasters and buddy holly occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers lives with the lives of the miners the film photographed by fred murphy also uses colors to set moods and symbolize the town of coalwood actually filmed in tennessee is washed with blues grays and browns it s as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything faces clothes houses and roads when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red the red stands out enough against the blue gray world of coalwood to symbolize getting out but it is still subtle the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal hope and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he isn t the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer s stubborn father who doesn t recognize or just doesn t want to admit that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive homer and everyone who encourages him in his rocket building is aware that the town is dying with the community disintegrating the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys demonstrations again i m sure things didn t happen exactly as the movie portrayed them but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism october sky has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real",

the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non existent in fact as i was watching it tonight on turner classic movies i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic singing in the rain may have taken some of their ideas from hollywood hotel most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen hollywood hotel is a fascinating example of movie making in the s among the supporting players is louella parsons playing herself and despite some negative comments i ve seen she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines she is not the only real person in the script make up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr ronald reagan playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman s band the beginning of this film by the way is quite impressive as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell they end up singing hooray for hollywood the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make up king rin tin tin and even a hint of tarzan but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of th century fox and the name donald duck was substituted in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman s orchestra at their best so did a later five minute section of the film where the band is rehearsing powell leaves the band and his girl friend frances langford and goes to hollywood only to find he is a contract player most likely for musicals involving saxophonists he is met by allen joslyn the publicist of the studio the owner is grant mitchell joslyn is not a bad fellow but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel which is also where the studio s temperamental star lola lane lives with her father hugh herbert her sister mabel todd and her sensible if cynical assistant glenda farrell lane is like jean hagen in singing in the rain except her speaking voice is good her version of dan lockwood is one alexander dupre alan mowbray scene stealing with ease several times the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was and lane when not wrapped up in her ego is fully aware of it having a fit on being by passed for an out of the ordinary role she wanted she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film joslyn finds a double for her lola s real life sister rosemary lane and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow up party but she attends with powell joslyn wanting someone who doesn t know the real lola this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself but otherwise the evening is a success and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell and his gang of hoodlums powell s contract is bought out working with photographer turned agent ted healey actually not too bad in this film he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point the two try to find work ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto eventually powell gets a break by being hired to be dupre s singing voice in a rip off of gone with the wind this leads to the final section of the film when rosemary lane herbert and healey help give powell his chance to show it s his voice not mowbrays it s quite a cute and appealing film even now the worst aspects are due to it s time several jokes concerning african americans are no longer tolerable while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood healey accidentally photographs a porter and mentions to joslyn to watch out powell photographs too darkly get the point also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane who is shall we say too high strung is not very tolerable either herbert s hoo hoo ing is a bit much too much of the time but it was really popular in and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere this was one of his last films reminds people of the tragic still mysterious end of the comedian in december but most of the film is quite good and won t disappoint the

sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is naively visualized but the sneaked in romantic moments between the to be married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressing v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the about to be couple waiting to get married playing by the rules simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of families i think amrita rao looks very good she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti i e amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahid s bro sis in law it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesome stuff like sanctity in a marriage relationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially praying sacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah there s still some good audience who r going enjoying this film some of the folks audience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arranged marriage thats success if you ask me it seems amrita rao our actress from vivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah shahid or amrita didn t get any of the film fare other awards least this is news to cheer about congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bride to be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way shudn t forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar its no mean achievement congrats to amrita rao for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur they make a cute couple and their on screen chemistry reminds me of srk kajol or aamir khan juhi chawla some points that i observed few of the elements if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film perfect fit shahid kapur is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage but prem listens carefully to the step wise talk given by his dad having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a st meet also its possible in the entire movie there are basically or sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together its unlike most other romantic wedding based movies where hero heroine are always singing dancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters girl kids in some parts of india romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenes songs are beautifully pictured words like jal praarthana e t c are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love i cant do without u its a hats off feeling in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshness on screen chemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewing business than dhoom or fanaa or golmaal or all those time pass fuzzy style crap movies",

        "text": "there are many adaptations of charlotte bront s classic novel jane eyre and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a min length consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine s life there are three tv mini series released in and the version is not only the worst of these three but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film the novel s beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set it is a silly soap opera in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the ies by mistake this jane eyre as it dares to call itself is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte bront the version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by jane s voice overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured another problem is the casting of the main characters sorcha cusack s portrayal of jane as a bold self confident worldly wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model and michael jayston although a good actor does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience all the faults of the version stand corrected in the tv mini series of with timothy dalton and zelah clarke although from a purist s point of view timothy dalton is too handsome tall and lean to be rochester he possesses the essential qualities for the role he has an imposing physical presence great magnetism and an air of self assurance and authority and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochester s character of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all rochester s harshness nearly insolence his moodiness and abruptness as well as his humorous side his tenderness his solicitude and deep frantic love dalton s handling of charlotte bront s language is equally superb even rochester s most far fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them he is the definitive rochester unsurpassed and unsurpassable and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester she portrays exactly the jane of the novel an outwardly shy reserved and guarded young woman but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will she catches beautifully the duality in jane s character her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight as regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the version but with one important difference the dialogues are shortened in this version but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte bront s language and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the series it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane s life it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel and the only one which does full justice to the novel s pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill he renders with almost painful intensity rochester s anguish as he realizes jane s resolution to leave him his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him it is a heartbreaking almost devastating scene which will stay with the viewer for a long time with even the smaller roles perfectly cast an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true jane eyre",

spite of its technical flaws brought the feeling back to me of reading jane eyre for the first time the critics of this production say it is too close to the book for me someone who valued the book and didn t need it to be any less wordy or any less christian or any more sexed up this version s faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest asset bronte wrote a darn good book there s a reason it has lasted years plus while other slicker sexier and easier texts have disappeared as a long time jane eyre fan i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester rochester is famously not handsome jane and rochester are literature s famous ugly couple and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester he just blew me away i ve never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role the text the dialogue and rochester s love for jane dalton brings the page s rochester to quivering life on screen rochester is meant to be a bit scary dalton is scary welles got the scary streak down too for example when he shouts enough after fontaine plays a short piano piece but dalton is scary more than once here you really can t tell if he s going to hurt jane or himself in his desperation rochester s imperiousness his humor his rage his vulnerability dalton conveys all sometimes seconds apart it s stunning and here s the key thing the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair lonely living with an ugly life destroying secret no other actor i ve seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does current fan favorite toby stephens doesn t even try dalton hits it out of the park if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar i would say that guy is trouble don t even look at him he s that radioactive with tamped down agony zelah clarke is not only overall the best jane i ve seen she s one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane no folks who know jane eyre only from the version bronte did not describe a statuesque robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips rather charlotte bronte s jane is indeed poor plain obscure and little and not pretty zelah has a small mouth close set eyes and a bit of a nose she s truly little she is no fashion model and she is the best jane the truest to the book some described her a cold or boring no she s true to the book bronte s jane is not a red hot mama she s a sheltered deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments as zelah s do here the book s jane is someone you have to watch slowly carefully patiently observantly if you want to truly plumb her depths you have to watch zelah here to get to know who she really is i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene but that s one scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very good in spite of its closeness to the text this version like every other version i ve seen shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in jane eyre christianity is not incidental subtext in jane eyre it is central helen burns instructs jane in christianity thus giving her a subversive counter cultural way to read and live her apparently doomed pinched life it is christianity and a christian god who convinces poor plain obscure jane of her equal worth her need to live up to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal that isn t made fully clear here in any case charlotte bronte wrote an excellent complex rich novel and this adaptation of it of all the ones i ve seen mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation i ve seen and that says a lot other versions that don t fully honor the book end up being a chore to watch in many places if you don t care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochester this version like bronte s novel realizes that everything bronte wrote about jane s experiences at lowood and her relationship to st john are part of what makes jane s relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is",

        "text": "okay so i m not a big video game buff but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though justifying any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be it s an interesting premise in house of the dead with a lot of college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion clint howard tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie i can t stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he s this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he didn t even rasp well it sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the friday the th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but let s consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year find no one and say well who wants a beer even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn t think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from director uwe boll there s alcohol they won t notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves so not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they re alone it s like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since there s no one else around brilliant now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i ve read about the movie yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure it was a stupid idea i can t imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don t have a lot of places to run since they re on an island but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead then you have what i call the techno slasher scene since the rave never happened and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie there s one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there s techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it s nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about frames long which is about of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you can t see any one thing for long enough to react to it you re just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie i ve seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they re exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not the case in resident evil it wasn t some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it s just too bad that house of the dead didn t do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i can t say that i know much about the game it s based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think that s more often the case than not with horror movies it s really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel",

        "text": "which do you think the average person would know more less about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi s latest film entitled offside a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one s right to do something or go somewhere and an individual s right to extend that courtesy if and when they d like to the odd thing is you don t come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless it s an education in panahi s controversial style but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it i can remember the world cup i m sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria anyone in britain that was watching the bbc s broadcast of the iran mexico game both nations first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the bbc s football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match it went something like we ve seen giants germany england argentina and holland play but now we get to see mexico and iran battle it out the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore it s a shame because there are people and films like offside present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well being to achieve it and it s sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem inferior when there are others who d do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage when immediately thinking of the words iran football and world cup my mind flies back to the france game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran s famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran s victory as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they defeat a western power or enemy at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are indian film lagaan in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket similalry s the game of their lives sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the world cup the differences between these films and offside are immense offside is looking at a situation behind a state s mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men may not will but may use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man s right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman s right to see the game all together it is no wonder panahi s film was itself banned in iran but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match panahi pays special attention to the title of his film offside which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an attacker is caught trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the womens position in the film as these advancing supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itself i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i ve seen it s a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo realist aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i ve mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the iranian government",

        "text": "i saw this film at the toronto international film festival filmed during an actual qualifying match for the world cup offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy the film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at tehran s azadi stadium the country s islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour this hasn t stopped the country s young female fans who continue to sneak in using various tricks but panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action they beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match the soldiers tell them they shouldn t have tried to get in that they could have watched the game at home on tv they banter back and forth in almost real time as the game continues just off camera there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom since there are no female restrooms at stadiums he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in plus he makes her cover her face so no one can see she s a woman this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali daei as a mask with eye holes punched out you get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family s cattle in the countryside little by little the girls and the soldiers talk to each other and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances however the soldiers constant reminder that the chief is on his way lends a sense of menace since we don t know what sort of punishment the women will face unlike most iranian films which are known for their strong visuals offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice in fact the film was made during the actual qualifying match against bahrain that took place on june the plot in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch if iran won the match they would qualify if they lost they would not since the world cup has come and gone i don t think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous which gave the film a real authenticity seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching as well one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran japan match on march just a few weeks before they were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction knowing that this was a real life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations i don t want to go off on a long political tangent but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it iran is a nation of young people and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties and it s my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them",

anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can t free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around him a man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn t remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember reign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasn t felt in years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle s character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler s doesn t mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the fa ade they have created for themselves the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writer director mike binder s role as sandler s old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorc e trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i don t know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope",

months due to its very long wait all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it then one day out of the blue it finally arrives and it s a total snore sure maybe i had elevated expectations but i don t think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh the thing is it s christmas in some canadian college town and there s this sorority having a party we see some killer pov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic so we know he s in the house then we re introduced to our characters olivia hussey as the mousy whiny canadian accented jess margot kidder as the annoying overtly aggressive alcoholic barb she s so annoying even her mother dis invites her for her christmas festivities there s also this irritating janis ian clone phil and this alcoholic den mother mrs mac seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house we also meet jess s highly strung boyfriend peter played by keir dullea of and bunny lake is missing fame though halfway through the film i was still asking myself which one s keir dullea so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls but this was before email so they couldn t ask him to send a photo then well you know how they say those plastic dry cleaning bags are not a toy one of the sisters finds that out the hard way don t worry if you don t catch the first shots of the plastic encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic there ll be more interspersed throughout the film obviously there to make you say oh my god there s a corpse in the attic though after the first hour that changes to how come the dumb police haven t found the rather prominently placed plastic encased corpse in the attic especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house really any time before csi came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime the cops are so dumb fortunately some of them look like john saxon anyway after a lot more darn boring human drama the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy looking trap door that rests atop it those wily cats for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble now we have two corpses up in the attic hey why don t we have more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the attic so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously and tap the houses phone and station a cop outside they inform jess and her pal janis ian that if the obscene caller calls back they need to keep him on the phone jessica who has grown even more whiny mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller who is this what do you want who are you after like the first calls when it is clear that he is not going to answer her isn t that like a sign a developmental disability the inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something and what s he going to do suddenly say oh yeah hi it s bob from the laundromat dumb jess spoilers anyway soon janis ian and lois lane kidder are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces this film s idea of gore and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked hello are you being stalked or what then the cops realize that the killer is in the house and call jess and tell her don t ask questions just do as i say walk to the front door and get out so what does moron jess do starts screaming phil barb phil barb hey great idea sister now why don t you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking of course she does and sees her former friends all splashed with ketchup prompting this viewer to scream at the screen have a clue now now obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place and that it doesn t move to the same pace we re used to and seeing a plastic covered corpse in the attic like times probably was scary back in the day and people weren t used to being stalked by psychopaths so they wouldn t think to you know lock the doors or windows and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there you see people were stupid back in the s we have to understand that one of the big shocks is that we don t even see our proto final girl kill the psycho but believe me that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for spoilers end hey check out cinema de merde my website

the movie jumps the shark uav s aren t armed they could be but i don t think it s ever been tried for real we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation called r i p l e y we are introduced to hacker will farmer he s good at chemistry electronics which doesn t make him a computer hacker his love interest annie will s st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical company wills taking money from his neighbours bank account mr massude isn t a hack he helped him set up the account we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war they play the dead code the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massude s pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will exactly why ripley shut will s machine down isn t explained he s only playing an online game also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable as for ripley activating his mobile phone i think not it wasn t connected to the pc and the message wouldn t play unless he actually answered the phone so there s more bad hacking science there too ripley agents arrive at massude s home take him away will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn t a hack as you never see him break into the dmv computer the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he s looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him will s mother hadn t been stealing chemicals bio agents either and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis patriot act or not i don t know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will his mother dennis wasn t sanctioned by a government agency the phone phreak we see will do is the st show of any hacking skill in the movie we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system the guy who ran into annie at the airport was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced the joshua project we discover that the guy who ran into annie is falken not played by the original actor sadly who faked his own death we also get to see wopr as what s going to help them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then falken wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill will annie the russian it s also unlikely they d create a self contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of the whole decontamination plot idea are totally unbelievable those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff so yet another laughable unbelievable idea the ip hacks against ripley aren t done by will he just contacts one of his friends who suggests implements the idea it s excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley s operating temperature having joshua as a backdoor into ripley especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible cop out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown saying minutes then ripley says decontamination in minutes how crap is that when they can t even keep up with their own timer ripley s attack mission against philadelphia is halted far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she s doing won t work surely she d already know if she had joshua insider her as he d already learnt this lesson in the original movie is yet another nod back to the original movie their cop out at having ripley repeat joshua s exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with if you want to point fingers for bad stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat rob kerchner this is an awful movie and is best avoided",

        "text": "someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout demon seed cube the remake of thirteen ghosts but it s at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt it s all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central the idea is this an architect has built actually rebuilt for himself a huge and rambling house his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self centeredness but also it is intimated because she can t get used to the place since he remodeled it living in unaccustomed solitude real this time rather than virtual he comes to suspect that somebody else a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared is living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees him this is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn t foresee or doesn t remember the movie would turn into a cat and mouse game a hunt a battle and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didn t expect then he would be forced to think himself out of it and maybe at the same time out of his own self imposed isolation and in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the er nothing like this happens in this movie the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is installed in the house if he is the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing he calls the police they think he s slightly nuts he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks he s more nuts at last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder doesn t get a good look but figures who else could it be not a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key i don t know why he thought this necessary and leaves his victim to starve i missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel in any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place and this is it the architect are you ready moves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his and lives there in the same way how is this possible it is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin their neighbor whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in the architect takes up residence with martin s wheelchair ridden wife unbeknownst to her so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he s able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger who doesn t know he s there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer but at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat burglar entirely incredible not to go into the series of twists at the end including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair two nice people who take murder in stride and before the story started the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses to the final long anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and then ends here is a story that depends on the development of two things the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is and fumbles both the first fumble makes it boring the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnel builder and sneak tenant the story should be redone by someone some day",

booze like rivers and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual sounds like a place we would all hate to be right director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl suzette played by patsy kensit these two have chemistry and while suzette looks like a pre rehab lohan to me they worked there was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like lava and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled i was ready but then something happened temple takes us out of the nightlife takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first suzette runs away colin becomes a pervert and bowie well i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain i can tell you that much temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger we learn about colin mainly but nobody else i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era also were they teens really they all seemed like they were pushing their late s but maybe it was my tv character development thrown right out the door temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin s parents of which i didn t know it was them until after the film and a song which screams apathy great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands then if that wasn t enough we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going and temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme i didn t think racism would be on the top of the bill suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race somebody help me out here it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off to me the ending of absolute beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number that first part set the pace and temple could not keep up overall i must say that temple can direct a music video but i don t think he was quite prepared for the feature film i don t think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come it is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside i wanted some cutting edge work but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the s but by the end it just felt forced i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to motivation by the ever freaky bowie in this film it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status i am glad that i watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning but he couldn t control his characters way too many and the songs didn t seem to match the final moments of the film it came out of nowhere and it was unwelcomed if this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning absolute beginners was a welcomed adventure but i don t think i will be dusting this film off in the future grade out of",

        "text": "a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a children s film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the children s fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore but wait there s also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demon spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate resentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals those whove played the video game sonic the hedghog might remember a certain dr robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly s who sonic had to then liberate the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans of course in this magical world of miike s yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children s fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all s well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with it s yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon s pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of over consumption the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformed this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as there s a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness though i ve focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually it s a kaleidescope of cgi stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well there s a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either the yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a children s film however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more often all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performances the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn t come close to his apex instant classic",

they ll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs that s the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because there s nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in peter hedges found hornby s voice for about a boy and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in writers d v devincentis steve pink john cusack and scott rosenberg didn t go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby s wit and humor they made one of the best films of that year so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry the british version wasn t a masterpiece but it was charming funny unexpected and gave us two characters we could like respect and understand but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby s work in americanizing the story they ve butchered it removing all that was good and unique about hornby s work and replacing it with conventional drivel they ve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy never once veering from the wretched formula lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends each of whom has a distinct function one s overweight the second s cynical and ambitious and the third s a romantic want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon has what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady but engaging supporting characters in this fever pitch the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny they re so insignificant they re not even decorative the only reason they re in the film is because the formula demands it poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey s pals in a thankless role the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away come to think of it cusack would ve made an excellent ben of course cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script there isn t a single solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced every plot turn is predictable every lame joke telegraphed ganz and mandel labor for laughs the first minutes are so excruciatingly slow you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch it s almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru s formula pasted on the wall when they got to a certain page they looked up at the formula and said ok the guru says this has to happen now and presto directors bobby and peter farrelly don t help the film any they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the v o narration not to the protagonist but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park thanks to some extremely clunky writing we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings barrymore does cute and adorable better than most she s as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday but even her cuteness can t save this extraordinarily awful film she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story about minutes into the film lindsey tells ben you re funny the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script for fallon s ben never says anything even remotely funny fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy he overacts fallon was never any good on saturday night live he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallon s cohort tina fey knows a thing or two about comedy actors who think they re funny and behave that way rarely if ever are actually funny that s true of fallon he thinks he s hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle his stuttering unsure of himself shtick didn t work on the small screen it s lousier on the big screen unfortunately for fallon his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments if you thought his comedy was bad wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff two scenes in particular the first in a park the second in front of ben s school are painful to watch the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work his range of emotions doesn t even run the gamut from a to b ben has no personality or depth often he comes across as an oaf and not a lovable one at that it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him compare fallon s performance to firth s in the british version and you ll understand how terribly flat unfunny and forced fallon s ben is and how wrong he is for this role watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher just as high fidelity did an americanized fever pitch could ve worked brilliantly it just needed better writers more competent directors and most definitely a stronger funnier smarter leading man do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the british version and read hornby s book instead",

        "text": "i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn t expect a fundamentalist christian film the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being our hero who is a bible professor from the s eventually travels forward to the s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil jesus is nowhere to be found this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg wells style time machine the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film earlier or perhaps immediately later can t remember for certain our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful in any case that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time so if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn t a very strong believer as i don t think there s any evidence and none was offered for the physics of time travel in the bible so immediately there s a problem with mixed messages and credibility there but never mind after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date it s just two thousand and honk some of the shock went on a little too long though for instance the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he s invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van he sticks his head out the window like a dog might is scared by the headlights and the starting engine etc that seemed a bit off since he d been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic in any case that s easy to ignore the rest of the tech shock was well done especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn t even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote unfortunately our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he s an authority on all life and religion just because he s from the past and is an elder eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful but mostly was just more of the same a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy go figure and investigate his name they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is the movie frames these guys as non believer bad guys for being skeptical just before the professor is to head back to his own time he is confronted by those two men in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away he eventually breaks into an almost insane like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he s a prophet so they should listen to him just in time he s whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he d heard so much about the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self proclaimed and most likely false prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god given knowledge that was stated or even hinted at as i understand it revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying and failing to send a bible into the future first then etc as the scene fades out clearly he s trying to determine the exact date of the end times which he shouldn t be able to know essentially the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only it means there couldn t ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know the entire movie s premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it s own credibility in the end",

become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say this it s wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approach plot simply stated it s not boring most hollywood movies give tried and true plots that they know will connect with people often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched the weather man and lord of war and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they don t take any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after you ve watched a fair amount of american films domino s plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man they re screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the movie characters i felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that choco was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to domino s lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the team they all rang true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic rourke s character was the least interesting to me but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope that s what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that s what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to live claremont ladies i believe that they provided much needed heart to the story they weren t just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this child s illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting christopher walken guys they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walken s awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the guys being has beens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable cinematography yes the cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the look of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn t as peachy or clean as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren t just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie weren t expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and i m glad that scott tried to make something different granted this movie isn t for everyone but to say it s trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i m glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but i m sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the sphere of mtv won t appreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously",

        "text": "i m going to write about this movie and about irreversible the in famous scene in it so you are warned if you haven t seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intended acting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldn t period then we also have the bartender nd rape dude actually i don t think you would need him at least not for the nd rape but more about that later on let s reprise the story rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend this wasn t intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them rosario s character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to differ because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother here s another problem after the first rape takes place rosarios character doesn t tell anyone what happened seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if rosarios character wouldn t call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party it s obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone the first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like you re getting hit with a sledge hammer after rape no we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her but left in the open no real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the nd and last rape scene it s apparent that he isn t a nice guy and his character get s fleshed out a bit but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that rosarios character isn t the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist who cheats on a test gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really as absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career well career is a stretch and he is bullied this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too clich to stay with you so rapist submits to rosarios character why exactly because he promised her it was her day again really a guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drink so rapist undresses and get s blindfolded and let s rosarios character tie him on a bed seriously that s just crazy but what comes next is even crazier first she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this isn t about what this guy deserves or not it s just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist if this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up this isn t supposed to be entertaining enjoyable it s a hard watch it is art house but the minute i didn t count rape scene at the end just smashes everything rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointment irreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly this is where the art house movie should ve come in it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didn t actually physically do that much see above a broken character that the movie cuts off good intentions talia and rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesn t work not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are",

who was none other than australian kickboxing s favorite son stan the man longinidis the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than or feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia s greatest kick boxer he said that he wasn t a sell out he was happy and a retiree he wasn t ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film yes you heard right he plugged his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty minute clip of this vile film called trojan warrior this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight for now stan plays ajax a kick boxing ex special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne ajax s cousin theo arthur angel recently sold out well at least stan didn t stray too far away from everything to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party it s all pretty ridiculous but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again i ll admit i was actually pumped to see this i love action films even if they re corny and especially if it s set in my own backyard but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of god please make it stop subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most over choreographed fight scenes that didn t even remotely reflect stan s actual talent in kickboxing the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous dermot brereton mark chopper read and greg matthews the whole time you re sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on split second appearances by former celebrities remember those plot holes i told you about ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for buggery this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn t actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now that s a marriage amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as a cross between jackie chan guy ritchie has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing well anything and guy ritchie is the crime film messiah and you re comparing him to salik silverstein this film is more like a mix between pizza and enter the ninja now where do you thing the whole trojan warrior title comes from ajax s fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior no the gangsters unification to find theo like that of the trojan empire no it s because wait for it theo carries a condom around with him yes that right because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket he is a trojan warrior i had the displeasure of seeing trojan warrior on dvd as well as it s special features video clip of chop chop a rap song by mark chopper read chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap the funny thing was chopper just rapped for seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their australian accents face it people rap was developed in the states leave it there the clip looked like something a channel cameraman on ecstasy put together bloopers there was no real difference between these and the actual film stan the man longinidis kickboxing featurette this wasn t too bad considering it was just or different fights shown from different angles i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about times in that minute montage i don t want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but oh wait i just did my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy or copies of trojan warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad",
