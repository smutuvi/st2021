There were times when the pressure was fine- like in the very beginning when she asked- but then it was so light it was almost tickling! She seemed to want to focus on areas other than requested and seemed to need to use a stool to sit down a lot. It really felt like she wasn't into it so as awkward as it was- I asked her to stop. When I went to check out  I stood at the desk for over 5 minutes while 2 ladies behind the desk were on the phone. I was surprised by their lack of interest that the massage was substandard and they proceeded to charge me. I guess I'm grateful it was only the $30 for 30 minutes of massage but there was a sign in front of me that 'if your massage was unsatisfactory  let us know so we can make it right for you' That did not happen. I will not be back.",

This is a warning to all other meat eaters in Pittsburgh to not have their night ruined by Franktuary. \\n\\nBefore my wife and I met up with friends in Lawrenceville we stopped at Franktuary for dinner. There was a short wait and the hostess was very friendly. So far so good.\\n\\nOnce we got to our table I looked over the menu and saw they have poutine! I was very excited! I am not even Canadian and I love poutine. My wife and I order some dogs and poutine. This is where is starts to go down hill. \\n\\nAfter a short time we get our dogs. I got the Southern Belle and the Texan  they were both good but I feel they were not worth the price. I could of made these at home. My wife got the Bangkok  and she said it was nice. If I was just judging this place on dogs and forgot about  what happened next it would of been a solid 3 star experience.\\n\\nThe same time our dogs came out so did what they call poutine. When I took a look at it the cheese curds looked like little pieces of chopped up rubber and unlike cheese curds I have had before. Then once I took 2-3 bites I finally put a flavor to what I was tasting. MUSHROOMS! \\n\\nThat's right  mushroom gravy! NOT chicken or turkey gravy like its supposed to have. Nowhere on the menu does it say that this is vegan or vegetarian. At no point did our waiter warn us about this deception. I felt cheated and abused. \\n\\nIf they would have said something on the menu about this blasphemy I wouldn't have been so upset about it and probably still would have ordered it.  But it's the fact that they didn't that pisses me off. It's like they thought we wouldn't notice that they tried to pass off supar vegan gravy on us. \\n\\nI have never had vegan anything that taste like the food its trying to replace. But that's not my problem since I eat meat. So please  don't push your life choices on me with your deceptive menu.\\n\\nI give Franktuary two stars  meaning I will never go back myself but I wouldn't try and stop someone else from trying it themselves. \\n\\nAbout my Ratings:\\n1 Star - I will never go back and will try my best to keep other people from going there.\\n2 Stars - I will never for back but wouldn't stop someone else for trying it themselves. \\n3 Stars - I would come back if someone suggested it. \\n4 Stars - I will come back often and will try to get new people to come with me. \\n5 Stars - My second home.",

My initial interaction with Sean wasn't the best. I called her expecting to set up an appointment  only to receive a less than \\\"\"\"\"warm\\\"\"\"\" reception from her. Sean was rude  irritated and short. She basically told me (paraphrasing) that I needed to pay her up front by depositing the money in her account. Hmm! Ok! I immediately went to Wells Fargo  deposited the money so she would at LEAST take me seriously. After I made the deposit she explained to me that recently she had been setting appointments for people who didn't show. Odd  but ok! I need my hair done! She makes the appointment  assures me that she ll be ready 6am and it will take her 8-10 hours. I wake up at the crack of dawn to only knock on the door to NOTHING. Nobody comes to the door! I call her  NOTHING. I hated to bang on the door but  I drove 25minutes away from my house  at 5:30am! Finally  a smaller version of her came to the door. It was her gorgeous daughter! She was so sweet. She apologized and said her mom was still sleep. She tried to make me as comfortable as she could. Sean came down 20 minutes later explaining that she was up all night doing hair. Before she started  I told her that I wanted my micro braids to NOT be cut. I don't want them all being the same length (personal preference).She told me ok  and got started. After about every 2 hours  she would call her daughter to cut the \\\"\"\"\"fly away\\\"\"\"\" hairs off the braids (to make them neater) and flat iron the hair (which was odd again. Who flat irons synthetic hair? )while she laid on the couch and tried to get 10 minutes of sleep. Fine by me until I felt my braids get a lot lighter. She CUT MY BRAIDS! The very THING that I didn't want. I couldn't even be mad at her daughter though. I immediately said \\\"\"\"\"Oh nooo!\\\"\"\"\" Her mom woke up and said \\\"\"\"\"She didn't want her braids cut!!\\\"\"\"\". I'm thinking  \\\"\"\"\"Why are you yelling at your daughter  when it's YOUR fault?\\\"\"\"\" Her daughter wasn't around when I told her that I didn't want them cut!  So  now I'm just sitting there frustrated. Then as Sean is braiding  I'm noticing that she's braiding down only midway. Meaning  I still have my REAL hair sticking out of the synthetic hair? WTF? I asked her \\\"\"\"\"you're not going to braid it all the way down\\\"\"\"\" She told me no. I paid her EXTRA $$$ because my hair is longer  and I have a big head. I'm used to paying a little bit more. Only to not get my hair ALL THE WAY BRAIDED! So now  I have cut braids with my hair sticking out the braid. No wonder she says you can't get the braids wet! I get braids SO that I'll be able to get my hair wet! The conclusion was  I had small braids with the bottom of them being BIG AND POOFY. She KNEW I wasn't happy as she asked to take a picture of it and saw my face. Her response? \\\"\"\"\"Smile  you'll get used to it\\\"\"\"\". It took me a WEEK to braid those braids all the way down. Of course she posted my picture on her fb page. I like to actually get my hair braided for convenience. Not a week of inconvenience!\"",

Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor  especially for a \\\"\"\"\"signature\\\"\"\"\" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry  even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless  and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all  with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork  and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth  perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food  but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness  and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again  like so much in Vegas in general  it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good.\"",

As we sat they got busier and busier and that's when our service got worse and worse. Our food came and it was very bland  drinks very dry  and the service getting worse and worse. We would get the occasional how is everything  how are you guys doing followed by a dash off  not even to stop and hear the response to his question. My brother ordered a drink  to which he got a response that they don't have that drink  this was not the case. The actual waiter didn't know that they even had this drink on the menu.. Very disappointing service  very bland and tasteless food.. Definitely wouldn't recommend it if your here in Las Vegas..",

Never have I had such terrible service but what makes it worst is that it was from multiple people (including the manager) WOW!! Only reason this place has 2 stars and not 1 is becasue it is located in a cool hotel. No way no how will not ever stop by at this place again. Incredibly rude and unhelpful people. I was appalled at the way the manager or supervisor lady we spoke to runs this place. We walked by on the weekend of my birthday before heading back to LA around 11:30am on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that they were currently not seating anyone and to check back in about 20 minutes. We tried to ask if we can just sit at a table and have a drink but again she was persistant with more or less the same answer but in a much more rude way.  So we took a walk around Mandalay for a bit then upon our return around 12 we were told the same thing. At this point we were a bit frustrated and mad so we asked to speak to their manager. The lady came out and explained to us that they were changing cooks so could not seat anyone. But not only that in a very rude and snarky type of way  almost as if speaking and explainng was painful. We just wanted to sit out by the patio area and have a few drinks and people watch. But apperantly thats way to much to ask for these people. We finally ended up getting a table after somewhat of a heated confrontation from the bitter clueless manager. We had a few drinks and bought a few bread items/pastries from inside but could definitely feel the unpleasent welcome. How difficult is it to say sorry the kitchen is currently closed but if you wish to sit outside and enjoy some drinks go ahead. I mean geez it is freaking VEGAS how can you deny people drinks  she was very clear and did not want to let us sit in the patio table area she said we could sit at the bar but I guess customer service and making money is not exactly their first priority here... If I were the owner or person in charge I would seriously think about training the employees better. I know the hostess was just following directions but one would expect a person such as the female manager/supervisor to be a bit more competent with customer service as apposed to chasing money away. Will definitley tell everyone I know that is going to Vegas (specificly Mandalay Bay) to avoid this place like the plague.",

It looks very cute and nice on the outside and my apartment has been updated with vinyl floors that look like hardwood. It also has very cute custom paint on the walls. As it looks very appealing as to the reason I moved in  there has been nothing but issues since I moved in. The walls are thin  so if your neighbors play music  you can definitely hear it easily. Also  the tenant above me has hardwood floors so I can hear them walking back and forth. So far since I've moved in  I believe they have shut the water off at least 10 times to do maintenance. The day I moved in  there was a flood in the club house. There has been a pipe burst outside that flooded the parking lot. Today there was a flood and they had to turn off the water to the whole complex. When I called the emergency after hours line  they said it happened at 2am. It is now almost 7am and they haven't notified anyone by any means of communication that nobody in the building will be able to shower this morning. I've also had a problem with bugs  I have found a few baby cockroaches and centipedes in the unit. I'm a very clean person so the bug problem is a huge surprise to me. I have notified my property manager with the multiple issues as well as the building and it seems its always someone else's problem. In other words (mine  the tenant). Which is B.S. if you ask me. I gave it a two star rating because it does look nice and there is very good security 24 hours a day.

Didn't call either. It's very disappointing that most contractors don't put pride into their work  and seem to get away with taking your money for a shoddy job.\"",

They cooked it medium but just barely as they knew he liked it medium rare. The kids meal was a great deal  macaroni and cheese with a side of baked potato. My kids were able to split it so it was perfect! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken flat bread. It was sort of like a pizza with balsamic marinated chicken  olives  onions  and feta.

I scraped most of it off and left it on my plate. Don't get me wrong it was still delicious  but with no melt-able cheese to hold everything together it was a little hard to eat and everything kept falling off. And that much feta is just too strong.

He ordered the cake two days prior to needing it (although this location claims they only need 24 hours notice). He clearly explained to the employee that he needed the cake promptly when they opened at 10am to which she replied that would be no problem. When he went in to pick up the cake at 10:15am  it was not ready. The employees claimed that the top of the cake had not been finished  however we later realized that the cake hadn't even been made at all yet. They informed him they needed an extra 30 minutes to an hour to complete it. Two hours later  we came back to DQ to pick up the cake. It looked absolutely atrocious. It was obvious that the cake was rushed to be made as it was not frozen and the icing work was incredibly sloppy. At this point  my boyfriend was very frustrated and asked for a manager. After much conversation  the manager went to the back of the store to speak with either another manager or the owner of this franchised location. He then begrudgingly offered to take the cake back and refund the money or take $5 off the price. My boyfriend decided to take the $5 off  however looking back  we wished we would have given the cake back and taken the refund. I also found that offer quite strange because I am not sure what they would do with an already decorated cake. Regardless  these cakes are quite expensive and should always be made properly and on time. The owner of this location should be embarrassed they are selling such a poor product.\\n\\nOverall  this was an extremely poor experience and we will never order another cake from this location. If you are looking to order a cake  consider the Windmill location as we ordered one from there previously and it was made perfectly.",

But sip after sip  I enjoyed it more. Energy boost for sure!\\n\\nI decided to eat-in and do some leisure reading. While doing so  I noticed that all the customers were regulars. They were all on first-name basis with the workers. And once a yoga class was done  seeing all the post-workout Yogi's trickle in with rejuvenated smiles  I couldn't help but notice the friendly vibe all around. Since the cafe is directly connected to the yoga/spin studio in the Improvement Club  this must be super convenient for a post-workout meal. I'll be back to try one of the classes.. as an excuse to try a new Juice/Smoothie :D\"",

The issues weren't bad enough that I wouldn't come back  so I decided to give them a second chance. \\n\\nSecond chance  we called in an order to go. Just a large pepperoni pizza  nothing too difficult. The girl on the phone sounded super confused like she didn't know what was going on and my husband even commented that he was worried we'd get there and there would be a problem with the order. So we get there  I tell them I called in and order  and the 5 people working there all look around at each other and say  \\\"\"\"\"I didn't take an order\\\"\"\"\". After telling them  \\\"\"\"\"Someone answered the phone because I placed an order\\\"\"\"\" a girl comes out of the back and said she as the one who took the order. She handed us the pizza and didn't say anything. I had to ask what we owed. She looked lost and confused like she was on pills. The rest of the staff then tried to overcompensate by being phony friendly  which I wasn't going to buy since one of the girls was on her cell phone texting and wouldn't look at us. \\n\\nOverall  the food isn't bad  but I'm not sure it's worth dealing with the incompetent staff. I may give them one final chance before writing them off altogether.\"",

Then waiting for the beer was painful  We could see the beautiful bar tender tending to everything except getting our beer as well as the beer for the adjacent table.  They ordered before we did.

Wait  wait....wait.   No manager  no nothing...  Where does this manager hang out during lunch?  I offered to pay with cash and was told the manager still needed to remove the charge.

Second was how great the restaurant looked  it was clean and inviting. The bartender smiled and waved at us like we were old friends and told us to have a seat anywhere...(time was 12:22)\\n\\nSo far we're off to a great start. So what possibly could have went wrong to cause a 2 star review? Our service. \\n\\nThe bartender brought us over some menus and explained that we could order brunch or lunch  brought us some chips and salsa  then went back to the bar  we didn't see any other server in the restaurant so for a while we thought she was just ignoring us. So we sat and sat and sat waiting for our actual server to come by. Keep in mind there were 3 other tables in the restaurant  one was just leaving so we'll call it two. \\n\\nLet's touch on the chips and salsa. I loved the chips  they were fantastic  however  the salsa was not a \\\"\"\"\"dipping salsa\\\"\"\"\" it had a wonderful flavor and would have been great on a taco salad (why don't you have taco salads?) or poured on the top of a burrito but it was horrible for dipping chips. There were NO chunks  it was the consistency of hot sauce. \\n\\nFinally our server greeted us with her presence  she walked up and didn't say \\\"\"\"\"Hi  I'm so-and-so  I'll be taking care of you folks today\\\"\"\"\" or \\\"\"\"\"Welcome to Lenero  have you been here before\\\"\"\"\" or even just \\\"\"\"\"hello\\\"\"\"\" instead she said \\\"\"\"\"what can I get you to drink\\\"\"\"\". I almost responded with an \\\"\"\"\"hi  I'm fine thank you for asking\\\"\"\"\" but I refrained. We ordered our drinks and I asked for an order of guacamole  it's 12:31 at this point (9 min after walking in the door). \\n\\nThere we sat  bored with our chips and salsa  read every yelp review of Lenero  discussed our plans for rest of the day etc. Our server finally came by to ask if we were ready to order. Not by asking if we were ready or if we had any questions. She walked up and in her snotty tone said \\\"\"\"\"what do you want\\\"\"\"\". Seriously?? That's not how you talk to someone! I was so taken aback by her attitude I decided right then and there we will not be back. This food would have to be sent straight from the Heavens for it to tip the scales back in the favor of the restaurant. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken tacos and my bf ordered the enchiladas. As she was walking away he mentioned to her we're still waiting on our guac  it's been over 10 min at this point. She seemed surprised by our request to get the guacamole  almost like she just plain forgot I even ordered it. \\n\\nFinally our guacamole came. TWENTY-ONE minutes after ordering it. By this time the appeal of chips and guac was completely gone. She gave a million excuses about how there were steaks that needed to be cooked and the cook is extremely busy. The only other table in the place had already gotten their food and was about to leave. That left one table of folks. You're telling me the cook couldn't manage to toss some guacamole together because he was too busy making steaks for the one table in the restaurant? She told us it was on the house. That was nice but I would have rather of paid for it and have received it 16 min ago. \\n\\nFinally the bartender came over to apologize for the guacamole taking so long and explained that the cook is new and he went in order of the tickets arriving and needed to prepare the food for the OWNER'S FAMILY first. So I've been sitting here hungry because the owner needed to eat and that took priority? \\n\\nOur lunch came out pretty fast and my tacos were good  what the menu doesn't mention is they are street tacos  not normal sized ones. Which was fine by me but I could see where someone else wouldn't have been impressed with 4 really small tacos. The enchilada was also good but the menu should clarify it is a spicy dish. While we both love spice  again I can see how someone else would not have liked it. If my mom had ordered it she wouldn't have been able to eat it  the dish was that spicy. \\n\\nBottom line is we do not have any intentions on coming back. While the food was good  it wasn't phenomenal. The salsa was not ideal for \\\"\"\"\"chips and salsa\\\"\"\"\" and the service was HORRIBLE. It's been a long time since I've had a server that snobby. She should be really lucky we left her 20% because she certainly did not deserve it (I'm having tipper's regret).\"",

Speaking of which  the Queso Fundito was the one thing highly raved about here  yet  ours came out as a luke-warm solid mass of cheese--not the dip-able queso we anticipated.

Now I need to share with you guys the worst dining experience I have ever had.\\n\\nLet me preface this by saying  I am a restaurant manager.  I know I am critical about service.  Even bad service I can sit back and chuckle about  but the end of this meal had me in awe.  We went here after work one night  not too late though.  I think they are open till 2 and wen went in at 11.  We were promptly seated and greeted.  Everything went great.  The food was great  it was paced out  we were not in a hurry so we were happy waiting a few minutes between courses.  Our server seemed knowledgable.  She checked in occasionally and had some good suggestions.  \\n\\nAll seemed to be going great.  When we were on our last course  with food still on our table  she came by and asked if we had decided on dessert yet.  Well  that's a little early to ask that when we don't even have a dessert menu in front of us and we are still eating our entree.  We said we were still eating and we weren't ready yet.  When we were done  a busser cleared our food.  We figured out that the dessert menu was on the regular menu which was in a drawer beneath the table.  So we pulled it out and she immediately came back and asked us again if we were ready.  We told her we needed a minute.  \\n\\nThat was the last we saw of her.\\n\\nAfter ten minutes  she had not come back  I even tried to wave down a manager  who ignored me.  I finally got up  went to the bar area where they were all hanging out and asked if we could order desserts.  The manager came over to take our dessert order.  The dessert came out  still no check backs.  About the time the dessert is delivered I see our server sit down at the bar with her friend.  They both have beer in front of them and start having food put in front of them.  Now my blood starts to boil a little bit.

The manager is behind the bar  the server is still sitting there.  I ask if we can have our check and the server looks at the manager and says  \\\"\"\"\"can you get her check.\\\"\"\"\"  What kind of restaurant do you run where your staff gets to drink and eat instead of doing their duties  and not only that but bosses around management to do their job.  I cannot even fathom how this is acceptable at this restaurant.  So the manager brings us our check  and I\\\"\"\"\"m still fuming  he apologizes for me having to get up and says he took care of our dessert.  I'm still fuming.  He comes back with our credit card and gives me a coupon for a free appetizer next time I'm in.\\n\\nThe server literally never came back to our table.  News flash...I will never go back in to redeem my \\\"\"\"\"free appetizer\\\"\"\"\" coupon.  \\n\\nAs I said  the food was amazing  it's a nice place and I know a ton of people have had great experiences here.  I was so offended by how I was treated  I will continue to tell people this story.  Any place that allows their staff to behave this way clearly is not run well.\"",

One of the guys convinced me to buy a 1-month membership for \\\"\"\"\"Express Plus: Protect and Shine\\\"\"\"\" package for $11.95 (normally $21.95). I was told this would not renew automatically. The first car wash was a free upgrade to the \\\"\"\"\"Protect & Shine Plus: Everything Wash\\\"\"\"\". My first time through was nice and the car looked great.\\n\\nI came back on 12/23/2012 after taking my daughter to the mall to get a picture with Santa. I decided to stop by and get a car wash on the way home. We got through the wash cycle and we were being pulled through the rinse cycle. Sometime before we got to the dry cycle my dash lit up showing I was losing tire pressure somewhere (my vehicle has one light for TPMS). At first I thought it was nothing since sometimes the light would kick off if the tires were just a little low. But just to play it safe I pulled my vehicle into a nearby parking lot and checked. I found my front passenger side tire was going flat and I could hear air rushing out of a broken tire stem. Somehow this got damaged by the car wash.\\n\\nI found and talked to one of the employees and showed him the damage. He took pictures and filed a report which he had me verify and sign. He also helped me a little bit with changing my tire so I could put on a spare. He told me someone would contact me soon after they do their \\\"\"\"\"investigation\\\"\"\"\". \\n\\nThe next day I took my car to Discount Tire Co and they fixed my tire and replaced the broken TPMS module. This cost me about $80.\\n\\nOne other thing  the sales guy lied to me about charging me for just a 30-day membership. Turns out they have me on a automatic renewal of $21.95.\\n\\nIt is now 1/19/2013  almost one month later and I have not heard a single word from Super Star Car Wash. I just submitted an online feedback at their website (I can find no office number for this place) and requested a reimbursement and cancellation of monthly membership I shouldn't have been charged for.\\n\\nI do not recommend this place.\"",

I took all the right steps to make them aware of my experience there  I emailed Dr. Williams  who is the Founder  President & CEO of FastMed. He did reply and said he would look into the issue and apologized for the bad experience. He then sent another email saying he forwarded my complaint to the Medical Director in Az and said I would be contacted shortly  that was 11 days ago I have not been contacted. I also called my insurance company and filed a complaint with them and was advised to also file a complaint with the Medical Board of Az. I am not looking to get the PA fired  which I know wouldn't happen  nor am I trying to smear her name...I just want her to realize that each patient is an individual. I know Urgent Care is exactly what it claims to be  it's a fast solution to a medical problem after hours. I wasn't expecting her to take the same exact care my family doctor does  but I was expecting her to clearly look at my history  examine the issue  ask questions  and of course advise me accordingly. She failed to do so in a professional manner and just to be a complete and utter jerk she throws insults at me in front of my 2 children.

The staff of cobblestone insisted that I need to change 2 filters and recommend a coolant flush in my car; and said it would be better for the air I am breathing as well as the car itself.

I always liked the Rutland  but it felt very much like a bar to have meetings in  or a subdued drink. \\n\\nThe Huxley has a great vibe midweek. I've yet to visit at the weekend. But yknow what? As far as a bar for a mid-week after-work drink and munchies goes  it's pretty good. I've heard amazing things about their burgers and hot dogs. I will be back to try these (the burgers come with two patties per bun?!)\\n\\nWhen I came  I tried a Grapefruit Mojito and it was really fresh and delicious. When a bar isn't specifically a 'cocktail bar' I can be very suspicious. So many times a cocktail can come unmuddled  or with chunky ice instead of crushed  and it can just taste like watery  alcohol with a sprinkling of fruit. Not at The Huxley. I happened to meet the mixologist at the bar  who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some cocktails for me. I love this kind of energy and passion. There were some delicious looking numbers there too.\\n\\nThe food menu is also really unusual  inspired and different. Hot dogs are  well  so hot right now. But there were also nibbles like Poached Duck Egg with black pudding and chorizo. Or a Scotch Dug Egg with HP sauce. Or Mini Chipolatas with dip  which I had. And the Battered Sole  with a side of seaweed salad.\\n\\nNote: do not put half the seaweed salad in your mouth at once. It tastes like the sea. Like the sea and fish. I used to have a through-and-through phobia of fish. It was not pleasant. I am assured  however  that a little nibble of the seafood salad is quite pleasant.\\n\\nThe Huxley is a new bar  and new bars take a while to settle into themselves. I hope it goes from strength to strength  however  as you can see they've put a lot of thought into the new food menu  the cocktail menu  and the new decor.\\n\\nNow  when can I go back for a burger?",

I have been a couple times and I just feel that for all the effort they are putting in  they are missing the final touches that would make this a commendable establishment. I really enjoyed its previous incarnation and was genuinely excited when I heard about this new concept.\\n\\nSo their premise is sound  a relaxed quality establishment that serves good value US style food and quality beverages  with the appropriate level of service - which is expected. This venue has always been synonymous with quality  well thought out concepts - see Kyloe upstairs for an example of how to get it right every time. \\n\\nMy problem here is that it doesn't really do what it says on the tin. The food is fine  not great  and reasonably priced - a frustration when you know the quality produce that is getting pounded out left right and centre on the 1st floor. The wine list and cocktails are relatively accessible  but certainly not setting my world on fire. The beer selection is AVERAGE  they have something like 10 pumps  and nothing overly exciting that you can't get in the majority of new boozers in town  the same goes for their bottled range.\\n\\nThe service is the part that makes this a well below par joint  and I know that will come as a surprise to a lot of people. I am ok if you want your team to be super cool  with trendy beards and tattoos all over the place  Timberyard pull it off without any effort whatsoever. But you need to make sure that these guys understand the basics of service. For example  if I order a beer at the bar and am told to take a seat and somebody will bring it over  then I don't expect it to take over 10 minutes to come. I also expect seasoned bar tenders to be able to deal with more than one order at a time. If you are offering table service  then make sure I get checked back on  and maybe offer me another beer before this one runs out  it's basic service. Finally  if you tell me I am ok to run a tab then make sure the bill is correct at the end of the night  my most recent visit was borderline attempted theft as the sheer volume of rogue drinks and 'double entries' on a bill which should have been a couple bottles of wine and a handful of pints was arguably more than just human error.\\n\\nLike I said  a good concept  poorly executed.",

This is the regular run of the mill manicure that I received and it was awesome.\\n\\nEverything else was pretty standard for a salon--the people were really nice  it was clean  etc.\\n\\nMy only tip: the new hot trend is to offer a free beverage ;) Just a tip.",

It wasn't hard for us to find either. The owner  Shawn introduced himself as well as greeted us as we entered. He was as funny as a comedian. The staff was very courteous and diligent. \\n\\nAt the time of the grand opening the hookahs were $10 and the second session was free. Even if they didn't have the promotion going on  the hookahs were reasonably priced at $15.00 as well as $12.00 for your second round. The prices for the food menu are also set at a great price as well.\\n\\nWhen we ordered the hookah flavor pirates'  cave. It came out very quickly because they already have a hookah set up at the table. The hookahs hit very good and lasted us around a hour on our first bowl. We ordered the kabob plate and it came with two sides. My boyfriend and I shared. Even though we shared the kabob plate  it filled us up pretty well because the portions are reasonable to the price you pay. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this place to anyone who likes to smoke hookah as well as enjoy middle eastern foods. You can't bet the prices either!",

The reserved table has still not been occupied and it had been about half an hr now. 2 more tables open up and they give the reserved table to the couple who had walked in after us. Maybe the employees knew them but they weren't the ones with reservations so it was BS that they got a table before we did.

Their employees are awesome  the food was wonderful! They bake their own bread and cakes on site. Tip- In a hurry???? Check out their drive thru if you can't wait long- my chopped salad only took 10 minutes to pick up.

        "text": "\"Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations. \\n\\nFirst impressions are not everything. Make no mistake  the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises  all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit)  employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!\\n \\nUnfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all  or maybe it is  just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun  pickle  hot peppers  tomatoes  onions  and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home  they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal. \\n\\nSome people will gawk at my review and say \\\"\"\"\"Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind.\\\"\"\"\" And to that I say \\\"\"\"\"My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment.\\\"\"\"\" \\n\\nWhat a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon. \\n\\nThe only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the \\\"\"\"\"American Dream\\\"\"\"\" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food... Sounds good on paper but  take heed  only one word can describe Portillo's: gimmick.\"",

It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes  I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.  \\n\\nThis Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor  shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry  dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-) \\n\\n If your feeling adventurous and hungry  I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good  try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this  but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload... \\n\\nThe only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food. \\n\\nIn looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!",

Upon entering the restaurant  we discovered that there was no one at the cash register  and no indication of whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us.

After standing awkwardly in the entrance for a few minutes  we decided to just sit down at a table  at which point a woman who had been sitting and eating at one of the other tables got up and said  \\\"\"\"\"Yes  wherever you want.\\\"\"\"\" Well  that would've been helpful a few minutes ago!\\n\\nSo  we sat down at a table  and the waiter came over another few minutes later to ask if we wanted drinks. Both The Wife and I ordered water  which he brought out  but  it was lukewarm (no ice at all) and the glasses were barely 3/4 full. He then walked away without saying a word about ordering food.\\n\\nNow  going in  we knew that the food would be served buffet style  but the waiter did not say whether we could just go up to the buffet or whether he would bring us plates to use first. So  I got up and went to look at the buffet. I discovered a stack of maybe 6 plates that I thought were clean (though I'm still not sure they were)  some silverware  and one bowl. I also glanced at the buffet items  and thought  \\\"\"\"\"Oh  god  what have we gotten into?\\\"\"\"\" The Wife came up to join me at the buffet  and while she was looking over the options  I started to serve myself some rice. I dug the rice scoop into the rice cooker only to discover that the rice was so overcooked that it was too hard to push the scoop into. So  I changed my mind about the rice and went to look more closely at the other food options.\\n\\nNone of the dishes were labeled  so it was a complete guessing game as to what food you might be serving yourself. The stuff that looked like chicken skewers were just sitting in a metal tray perched precariously on the edge of the buffet station  but they looked old and dry. One of the pasta dishes looked so slimy that it literally made me gag  and the other noodle dish looked old and crunchy  which is not how I ever want to eat noodles. The remainder of the dishes looked funky  old (like they had been sitting out for a while)  and  again  we had absolutely no idea what any of them actually were.\\n\\nGiven how terrible EVERYTHING looked and how bad our initial service experience had been  we set our plates back on the table  left $1 to tip for the water  and walked out. I wish I hadn't wasted money on the Groupon to this place  but that sunk cost was minimal compared with our desire to just say  \\\"\"\"\"Mabu-bye\\\"\"\"\" to this disgusting restaurant.\"",

I think the only sound we do hear is coming in from our old doors (which we will have them do as well  in the future :-)\\n Loved the professionalism and friendliness that Jeff showed during his demonstration  and we got the estimate right on the spot before he even left our home.\\nWe were appreciated that he didn't try to cut down other companies during his demonstration  (as another company had done). He just demonstrated his product very thoroughly with samples to choose from and knowledge to answer any and all questions we had. He didn't pressure us to make a sudden decision and told us we could call him with any further questions we had after he left.\\n The windows came in after about 10 days and Virgil and his assistant came on time the same week to start the amazing transformation of our home (which only took about  1 1/2 days). They were very clean  meticulous  efficiently hard workers  and took care and consideration of our 2 small dogs as well.\\nAnd to show how impeccable Virgil is with his work  he had noticed a slight dent on one the smaller window frames (that I seriously had to look very close to even see) and insisted on having Jeff reorder a new one  which Jeff did immediately.

There is stiff competition out there  but coming to the Blue Bear is an all-around fantastic experience.\\n\\nLet's start with the food. I love breakfast and  particularly  waffles and pancakes since I not only love the taste (including the great syrups  fruit or bacon you can add) but I also have fond memories of my Dad making waffles for us on weekend mornings. The Blue Bear is a fantastic locals' place and a family place that is buzzing with activity and diners eagerly awaiting their delicious meals or baked goods or coffees. I had the waffles with berry compote and my merry brunch companions had the full breakfast and eggs benedict. The full breakfast was absolutely huge  but it was perfectly done with delicious black pudding and sausage but also succulent  cooked tomatoes still on the vine. The eggs benedict looked great but was a bit overshadowed by the full breakfast calling my attention on the other side of me  and by my beautiful waffles that called 'eat me!' The waffles were gorgeous and I could go on and on about the berry compote! It was delicious and I have to say I worked hard to restrain myself from licking the plate clean.\\n\\nBesides the fabulous food  the Blue Bear has a great ambiance to it. The couple who owns the place are really sweet and extremely dedicated to the Blue Bear. They work hard to make sure every customer enjoys their experience and the food. I also loved how they work with local artists to display beautiful artwork that is for sale  as well as featuring some invaluable artwork by fellow Yelpers! This brings home the overall theme of the Blue Bear that  for me  it represents not only a fantastic new business with great food but it is also a locals' place that is community-oriented.",

I'm a massive fan of brunch and I'm always on the lookout for somewhere new to try to see if they beat Toast in Marchmont (current reigning champion for the best brunch in Edinburgh.) \\n\\nThankfully I've now been to the Blue Bear a few times and it really is a fantastic restaurant for brunch. The food is phenomenal and generously portioned. The first time I went for brunch and had the 'Big Bear'  their equivalent of a full breakfast  I couldn't finish it all. This was problematic for me as the food tasted so good that I didn't want to stop eating despite starting to make myself feel sick from being overfull. The Big Bear also comes with tea/coffee AND juice which is generous but way too much for me which leads to feelings of guilt that I can't finish my juice. \\n\\nI've also had the waffles here which are also a popular choice. It's disappointing that they don't have pancakes on the menu (or not that I've seen) as I'm much more partial to a pancake than a waffle. They are however very flexible in changing things on the menu. The last time I came here for food I had brought my eight year old (and very fussy eater) niece with me. She wanted waffles  but not a full portion  maple syrup and bananas please. Our waiter was kind enough to charge us a half portion of waffles and sort out the bananas for us. (They weren't on the menu at all.) Having a server who understands the pickiness of kids is amazing and makes a trip out with a little 'un less anxiety inducing as you worry what you can get them to eat. \\n\\nThe staff here are amazingly friendly and welcoming which makes coming back a real pleasure.

We indulged in sandwiches such as The Fidel  and their amazing OG Burger ... until today. This is their first day of a new menu consisting mostly of burritos. Our lunch party was shocked.

Sounds glorious right? The rice did not taste good  and there was too much of it. The orange chicken was good  but I was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you find at the grocery store. The rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either. The only approval was a co-worker who selected the BBQ chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. This  is possibly the only edible thing on the menu. \\n\\nHad they taken contents of the old menu  and put them in burrito form  it may have been acceptable. The Fidel in a burrito?

The appetizers were served promptly though  but there was no reason dinner should have taken nearly an hour. All we ordered was two salads and some lentils. We had to leave even before it was served because we had prior plans  and were nearly late. The reason our meal was late was that the kitchen forgot our order and the waitress didn't check on why it took 45 minutes to make two salads. The waitress apologized  but the manager don't even bother to talk with us.  I'm certain we will not go back. The appetizers we had weren't that great either.",

The lamb burger was succulent and the Brussels sprout cesear is a light option that had amazing flavors.

Although it (the meat) was very well seasoned  there were a few too chewy pieces and a lot of the tahini sauce which made the pita bread soggy. The Chicken Kebab Plate that my husband ordered was okay  nothing extraordinary. The hummus was good  though. Will I be back? Maybe  maybe not. I could give them another try but for me  there is definitely a better Greek Mediterranean place than Stephano's. Sorry :(\"",

We got it because it was cheap and close enough for comfort to the city  especially for the price. We stayed there in August (sorry late review) and from the moment we stepped into our dingy room I knew I was not going to be happy. Granted  we did not spend much time outside of sleeping in this room (thank god)  but the minimal time we spent there was HORRIBLE. The entire place smelled musty and old  our window faced a dingy alleyway  the air conditioner was old and barely capable of working. \\n\\nLet's get to the worst part...\\nTHERE WAS A MOUSE IN OUR ROOM. \\n\\n The 3rd night we came back into the room and I hear my mother SHRIEK and we see a little white thing scurry across the floor. To be certain  we made SURE it was a mouse before complaining... we waited for it to come out from under the dresser and run back to the air conditioner. We looked through all of our bags to make sure everything was clean and there were no other mice  and immediately went to tell the person working at the front desk. They (very hesitantly) moved us to another room (which gave them their 1 star)  and we did not see them even looking to catch the mouse  as far as we know... it's still there. The guy at the desk promised to write this up in a report and return us money for that ONE NIGHT (not the rest of the stay) because we only have 2 nights left and figured we might as well suck it up like adults. I checked back everyday we were there  and the manager never came up to talk to us nor made the time we agreed to meet. I emailed him TWICE to ask for a refund and nothing happened... he didn't so much as reply. \\n\\nMy family isn't big on complaining  and we could deal with the place  but the minute that mouse came out and they did NOTHING to help us..  we knew we were in for a bad bad ride.",

By the way it was pretty empty last time we were dining there but they just couldnt wait to get back to the bar i guess where all the waiters hang out??? Bummer we like the food but service has decided to mark it off the list of places to go.\"",

Our server switched flawlessly from French to English as they seem to do so well in this part of the world and as he listed the dishes  I knew we were in trouble. Give me all the things! Thankfully  Risa was able to pick some of the best items and order for us. Their salmon tartare was incredible. Perfectly fresh and gorgeous. We also enjoyed the octopus appetizer and though that's not typically my thing  it was savory  a little smoky and not at all chewy. And accompanying all of these are three hot salsas on the table. Apparently Dave makes them. His restaurant menu is littered with nods to the southwest (chipotle  serrano) and these three little delights were no exception. \\n\\nAt that point  I'd gotten into my second cocktail. Their margaritas  Dave assured me  were as good as any I'd get in Texas. I had my doubts but when that fierce concoction arrived  I had to raise the white flag. It was perfect. As good or better than any I had growing up near the border of Mexico. A good margarita in Montreal may be hard to find - but Dave's got it down. \\n\\nOur mains were the pork and the (giant) steak with seafood. We may have over-ordered but by god  we we managed to eat every last bit of those delectable dishes. Then the dessert came. Seriously  trying to kill me.

ALL YUZU EVERYTHING. The fish was very high quality  but by the fourth course I think my citrus taste buds had punched in their overtime and gone home. Meh.\\n\\nA waiter then brought us a fine-looking plate of tuna sashimi  which our server had to unceremoniously repossess a few minutes later  as it was not part of the omakase and delivered by mistake. We were told that a sushi plate was to follow later.

I was at his first USA restaurant in NYC shortly after it opened.  I have always had an excellent experience until I dined at Nobu in Caesar's with two co-workers.  Yes  it is pricey...everything on the Vegas Strip is pricey and price was not the issue. Not being served your entr\\u00e9e was the issue.  I sat patiently while everyone was eating their food...there was a gap of about 15 to 20 minutes between when the first person's entr\\u00e9e was served to when the second person received theirs.  So  we all assumed my entree would arrive in the same time frame. So  I sat there...waiting. Our server was nowhere to be found.  Finally  when everyone else had finished their meals our server finally showed up and I inquire about my food status.  She looked shocked and said that it might take a bit longer. In the meantime she offered me a sushi roll...promising me that it would take 5 minutes to arrive...20 minutes later the wrong roll arrives.  I ate it anyway.  20 minutes after that an entr\\u00e9e was delivered to my table...the wrong entr\\u00e9e.  15 minutes later  my entr\\u00e9e does arrive....cold.  No apology from the server.  However  she did make a point of telling us that the entr\\u00e9e was removed from the bill.  The manager was called over  who again did not apologize and truly he did not care that I was leaving his restaurant without eating but did volunteer to take a whopping 20% off the bill.  Therefore  we all left Nobu with a bad taste in our mouths and me with an empty stomach.",

I got the Chow Mein. I instantly got a call from the restaurant to double check what I wanted. I said I wanted noodles  with veggies  and chicken. She told me it was with a white sauce and it was very hard to understand the rest. I got it  home and it was this gloppy thick \\\"\"\"\"white\\\"\"\"\" sauce with nothing but weird bits of lettuce  chicken  onions  and gross looking celery. Nasty. AND no noodles  just some weird fried bits I assume that's what she meant by \\\"\"\"\"crunch noodles.\\\"\"\"\" \\n\\nPerhaps my misunderstanding  but my God it did not even look edible for someone who wanted to have Chow Mein. My boyfriend got the roasted pork in garlic sauce but he threw his away too because it was just all goo sauce  like thick gel for a sauce.

Because at Town Square there is lots to do  shopping  eating  drinking  or just hangout and to do a little browsing  here and there. I was just going to give it a 4 star rating. But I now rate it at 5 stars all the way.  I recently discovered that Rave Motion Pictures has (ages 21 and up) shows.  So when you're looking at Showtimes  look for the shows that have (21+) next to the movie title.  This means you can order cocktails/alcohol beverages inside the theatre itself from a cocktail server. Cash or Credit Cards accepted. I was so happy to find that out.  So I order a Jack on the rocks. The Bar is located to the left of where you give your tickets. The Lounge area on the side. I'm not sure if you can buy the drinks straight from the bar  I'll have to get back on that one.  But if we can buy from the bar too.  That would make it even better.  Finally you can drink cocktails inside the theatre.  The seats are reserved seating  so when you get your tickets at the window  you can choose where to sit. Upon entering the theatre you will be shown to you seats. The seat number(s) you chose will be on your ticket stub. This kinda works because people won't usually get  seats next to you  if the show isn't too crowded. I left my Bar Tab open  So not even the middle of the movie my cocktail server returned and brought my second drink  Then took orders from other movie goers.  How sweet is that?????!!!!",

They've obviously worked out whatever service issues they've had because I've never waited more than a few seconds at the drive-through window to get my order.\\n\\nThe salad is delicious and filling and I'll be going back . This is a place I hope succeeds. I only wish they posted calorie info...it is supposed to be healthy after all.",

I ordered the cobb salad and was very disappointed. First there was lots of lettuce and it looked clean and fresh. However the rest of the ingredients were very much lacking: eggs  blue cheese crumbles (almost none)  bacon (chopped so fine and spooned on to) and 1 very tiny slice of avocado. There were lots of tomatoes. Since I didn't open it until I got home I was pleasantly surprised at the size. That being said they gave one little container of water downed blue cheese dressing. No way would it have dressed the entire salad. I was willing to pay the $5.69 for the salad but did not get my money's worth with the extra ingredients for sure. I will go back and order a different salad to see if I can get a 5 star salad next time. I would certainly look closely at the list of ingredients and compare it to what you actually get.",

It's nice to have staff sorry after a mistake  but  you can't survive in a business that cannot make it right the first time.   We arrived at 1pm and the nice front desk person said  Hakone Suite is not clean yet  I will put in a special request for priority cleaning.  We came back 2 hours later and oops  not ready yet.  The front desk guy said  it takes 3 hours to clean the Hakone Suite and we said BS.  I later talked to the maids who clean that suite and they said it takes 30 minutes.  We decided  screw the upgrade we were willing to pay for and checked into a deluxe king.  Minutes later the \\\"\"\"\"hotel manager\\\"\"\"\" calls me in the room and says  sorry  please stay in that room  we will transfer you to the Hakone Suite very soon.  Well  2 hours later after 4 pm  no one had called  I called and they said  oh yes  it is ready  we will send up someone to transfer your luggage. Sorry.\\n\\nNext morning we order breakfast food service.  I ordered 3 eggs and when it was delivered apparently in this hotel when you order an egg  you get 2 eggs so I got a total of six eggs.  LOL.  I called the room service back and said  maybe you should tell people that.  He muttered  sorry.   So  I sit down to eat the breakfast and the sour dough toast could have been used in the LA KING hockey games as a  hockey puck.  I called and oops  they said sorry  we had to order the toast from Caesar's kitchen and it took a long time for it to get here.  Really??  LOL.    The maids never called room service to pick up the dishes that were there when they cleaned.  Oops.  Another sorry.\\n\\nThe hotel manager called on check out morning and said she would call me back as she wanted to talk to me probably to give one of the many NOBU sorrys.  Well  she never did call back  but  it shows that a fish rots from the head down.

We bought the $5 Groupon  and ordering tickets online was a breeze  and picking your seats beforehand is a really good idea and I think that movie theaters should all implement some sort of seating arrangement so that you don't walk in to the theater with 5 people only to find that you have to split up or sit in the very front row.  The web experience is awesome.\\n\\nNow...on to the concerns.....I thought at first that the idea of a movie/dinner hybrid would be a good idea.  I was wrong.  I went to this theater twice after buying the Groupon.  The first time  when I got to my seat  it was covered in a white powdery liquid  like someone had a baby and it upchucked on the seat or something.  We told one of the waiters just to see if we could get it cleaned or get a towel or something to sit on...and then they said they would be right back.  So I stood....and waited...and waited.....20 minutes went by before I grabbed another staff member and asked them to clean it.  After that I waited another 10 minutes before a staff member came by with what looked like a spray bottle and a paper towel and tried to spray it down.  No luck.  All the waiter said was \\\"\"\"\"Thats pretty gross  I wouldnt sit there either.  Sorry  theres not much I can do\\\"\"\"\".....NOT \\\"\"\"\"Let me see if I can find you another seat\\\"\"\"\" or \\\"\"\"\"We are sorry  have a free movie on us\\\"\"\"\"  or anything.  It was just \\\"\"\"\"suck it up and sit in the goo  or go home\\\"\"\"\".  My wife slid over in her seat and we pretty much shared one seat for the entire movie.\\n\\nUpon leaving  we had our parking \\\"\"\"\"validated\\\"\"\"\"...meaning one of the staff members looked at the ticket  acted like she was doing something to it  and then handed it back.  When we left the parking garage  we found out that it WASNT validated  all the staff member had done was just write an X on it or poked a hole in it or something.  We had to pay an extra $10 for parking.\\n\\nThe second time we went was just as unpleasant.  This time we were able to get seats that were decent.  We got to our seats  and placed our order  which was just popcorn and a soda.  That was all we ordered.  About 10 minutes later  the guy next to me ordered a hamburger and a couple other things.  20 minutes later  once the movie started  the guy who ordered the hamburger received his meal.  We were still waiting.  It wasnt until 30 minutes into Iron Man 3 (1 hour later!)  and after checking with the staff on the status of the popcorn that we finally received it.  Well  then we bit into the popcorn  and it was the absolute saltiest thing I had ever tasted.  I love salty foods  I put salt on a lot of my food.  This was unbearably salty...like the kind where it almost stings your mouth.  I took two bites and tried to flip the popcorn over  because I thought that maybe the bottom half would be less salty.  Didn't work.  I dont normally send things back unless they are unbearably bad....I sent it back and asked for a lot less salt.  10 minutes later  we get the popcorn again  this time it had NO SALT at all.  We just ate it anyway.\\n\\nOn top of all that  my wife missed half the movie trying to fix our salt situation.\\n\\nHaving the waiters and waitress going up and down the stairs with their iPhone/ordering devices was also extremely distracting.\\n\\nWe had better experiences at Northlake or Concord Mills theaters.  We probably wont be going back to SMG.\\n\\nOverall  Mez just seemed more upscale.  While the ticket prices were sometimes outrageous there  SMG seems like a cheap knockoff.  The atmosphere is very different then Mez.  Mez was more like an upscale club that had a nice theater attached.  SMG feels like a cheap movie theater that happens to have a restaurant  and they don't know quite yet how to make the two work together well.\\n\\nWe went to Mez several times just to eat at the restaurant.....After seeing the food at SMG and experiencing the service  I doubt we'd go just for the food.\"",

The Wasabi was not fresh and also  there was no slivers of pickled Ginger to cleanse the palate as there has been on previous visits. The Sashimi clearly was not fresh (I've had it straight off of the boat  so I should know)  and sadly none of it rang my bell.\\n\\nThe Chicken Yakitori and plain  boiled rice was jolly tasty and just oozed with flavor.

The pork was tender and juicy  with a wonderfully tangy bbq glaze. I did not want to share my dish - at all - but I did.  Across from me  my bf ordered the beef short ribs  along with the sweet and spicy coleslaw and beans.  The short ribs had the perfect amount of fat to meat ratio.  They were cooked maybe between medium-rare to medium  so it was perfect.  The coleslaw was pretty good  too.  We also had the chance to try the mac and cheese.  I usually am not a fan of mac and cheese; i think they're just basic  simple  and I can microwave some of Kraft's and throw in some additional cheese and voila - I didn't have to spend money ordering a small dish of it.  Well  the mac and cheese was brilliant.  It was so creamy and light  with a mixture of stanky-good cheese.  The chef said it had a mixture of 4 different cheeses  just magnificently delicious.  We also tried the mashed potatoes as well  with  I think it might have been pesto drizzled on top  or something similar to it  and that was good too.  However  I was still focused on that mac and cheese.  I honestly started drinking the cream from it.  \\n\\nWe went in at about 8pm  an hour before close  and there was only one other table occupied.  The space is pretty open  with nice tables and decor.  There were some sports posters up though  which didn't really go with the ambiance the place educed. The chef/owner was nice  too.  He did seem a bit worn out  though. \\n\\n\\nAnyway  if you're up for trying a new restaurant with great food that is decently priced  I would definitely give this place a try.",

The guy running the booth was very rude and told me I had to go CLEAR AROUND to the West side of the place to get it! The email I had received from CY's fan club distinctly said the passes would be available at the EAST SIDE WILL CALL BOOTH...so imagine how pissed off I was that I had to trek my way on foot  in the raging heat  over to the west side to get this thing! Upon asking the guest relations people there where the meet and greet will take place  they had NO CLUE WHATSOEVER! \\n\\nAlso  it says on the Ak-Chin Pavilion website that concertgoers can bring in cameras that do not have detachable lenses and are not the big professional type...small zoom-lens cameras and pocket cameras are accepted. I go to bring mine in and they DENIED me! Told me I had to put my camera in my car...yet they let EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE by me in with theirs and theirs were the SAME TYPE AS MINE!!!! WHAT THE HOLY HELL??? This really annoyed me  as if every other thing I went through wasn't bad enough!\\n\\nSo...after I went through all that rigmarole  I get inside and I asked the guest relations people where the meet and greet will take place. These two women running the booth told me where and even when...and they were very helpful  polite  and friendly! Finally  someone with some brains in the place!\\n\\nThe concert itself was great...sound and visuals were amazing and well worth the money to come see the show. However  security did absolutely NOTHING to clear the narrow walkways to go get food and drinks  restroom breaks  souvenirs  etc. Instead  I came away with bruises and a sore hand from some drunk idiot who hit me with his beer bottle because he wasn't paying attention. Security in this place SUCKS! \\n\\nIt will take me a LOT to ever come to another concert here!!!",

I was quoted anywhere from $1500-4000 for a cabana at the Paradise Pool (where the pool party takes place).  So I opted to call my Amex Platinum Concierge.  They gave me 2 different price options.  $750 Food and Bev min for the Paradis Pool for a basic cabana or $250 min for cabana at the Nirvana pool.  After reading some of the reviews here on yelp  we opted for the Nirvana pool and was glad that we did.  \\nWe arrived at 10am to secure the cabana.  They have you go there \\\"\"\"\"airport\\\"\"\"\" like security to get to the pool.  For the party pool  you have to wear swimming trunks (no reg shorts) and no big bags for the ladies.  However  for the Nirvana pool  you can pretty much wear anything.  No food or drinks.  I suggest getting the \\\"\"\"\"complimentary\\\"\"\"\" wristband for the party pool as well.  We got a great cabana (#130) located right next to the walkway up to the party pool.  The cabana could comfortable seat 5-6 people inside with 2 lounge chairs out front.  There is a TV  safe  fridge (not sure what the purpose is since you can't bring in food or drinks)  and fan.  We were right next to the sandy entrance to the pool.  The pool is nice and not your typical hotel pool. You can bring out your drinks and just chill.  The DJ in the morning was spinning classic rock  that turned into Top 40 by the end of the day.  It is crazy that you can't hear the music from the party pool next door.  Food and drinks were reasonably priced.  Bucket of beers (5) were going for $30-35.  Service was awesome.  Everyone was hustling back and forth to get us our food and drinks.  Never had to wait long.  \\nWe also enjoyed walking over to the other pool and checking out the scene. Then walking back to our cabana to relax.  Even though this is the \\\"\"\"\"family\\\"\"\"\" pool  we didn't see that many kids at all.\\n\\nIf we every return to vegas  we would love to do this cabana again.\"",

It's the perfect mixture of relaxation and fun. The HRH suites are never loud and actually gives you a great amount of privacy. \\n\\nRehab was a little problematic. This was my first time to these kinds of pools in Vegas -- I came too late in the afternoon to grab one of the very  very few recliners and I didn't even want to think about the cabanas. I didn't know where to leave my stuff while in the pool  either. The pool itself is great  great music and atmosphere and not too crowded if you're cool with just lounging in the pool. \\n\\nThe one tiny problem was-and it wasn't entirely their fault either-how they took the deposit. The rooms were only $30/ night but they withdrew the $250 regular price of the room from our accounts (per night) which put a huge dent on how much we can spend. I guess next time we just have to prepare the accounts better. \\n\\nDespite being off the strip  it's only a $9 cab ride to the main attractions. I would pay that to get away from the hectic Strip atmosphere -- overall  I would definitely come back again (hopefully with this deal).

If you're like me  then Sunday morning is probably not the best time to go...but anytime during the week  when it's fairly empty  the pools are like a glimmering oasis of blue.

I think it must be under new management or ownership or both  because while I used to enjoy and frequent this locale  it no longer will be someplace I come back to.  I go to vegas 5x a year.\\n\\n1) New tower.  The rooms don't really seem any larger than the old rooms  and there are no closets (just wardrobes)  and there is way too much dead space because of the size of the bathroom.  Nice look and feel but poor on the functionality.  Also the room sound system only worked 1 of the 5x I tried to use it.  The other 4x it said \\\"\"\"\"system temporarily unavailable while updating the system.\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\n2) There were massive design flaws in this upgraded \\\"\"\"\"tower\\\"\"\"\".  They didn't design in enough sound proofing for the walls and windows.  You can hear the pulsating music and base of the nightclub as you are trying to go to sleep at 230am  as well as the nocturnal activities of your next door neighbor.  The curtains don't \\\"\"\"\"black out\\\"\"\"\" the windows  so you are fighting the sun at 7am.  Come 830am the massive pool music system is up for sound check and running so you can't sleep because the room is shaking from the pool sound system.  I know what the HRH is known for  and I expect loud music but I expect to not have it destroy my ability to sleep.  At any hour.  Isn't that part of the vegas \\\"\"\"\"deal\\\"\"\"\"?  Party hard and sleep in?\\n\\n3) The whole pool set up has become ridiculous.  You have to wait 45-120 minutes in line to get your wrist band depending if it's a Sat/Sun to go to the pool.  I don't pay 300+ a night to wait 2 hours to go to the pool.  And to pay 75 dollars as a hotel guest to go to the pool.  It used to be free for hotel guests to attend Rehab or some nominal charge  and the wrist bands were issued at the front desk at check in.  No crazy lines  no crazy expenses.  This is insane the way it's set up now.\\n\\n4) Are you ready for this?  A pool chair now has a 100 dollar food and bev min.  For REHAB sunday that jumps to 500 dollars.  As a result  85+ percent of the beach chairs were unoccupied and everyone was sitting on towels draped over concrete.  Somehow I don't feel I should be forced into choosing between being extorted or sitting on concrete given the Rack Rates at the HRH.  I would obviously have skipped waiting in line 90 minutes plus paying 75 dollars as a hotel guest if anywhere it was mentioned on the web site or marketing materials that a chair was 500 min food and bev.  I would have saved my time and money and done something else.  Wasting time is one thing  wasting money is another  and wasting both is inexcusable\\n\\n5). Really cheap on the comps.  Look  I don't play 5-10 dollar hands  and I don't play for 15 minutes.  I play hours a day at a respectable average bet.  Most casinos vie for my business and it's reflected in the sizable comps.   The comp rate here is as bad as the Venetian /Wynn.  And with much fewer rollers or high rollers.  And not a whale in sight.  How does this make any sense?\\n\\nHRH  I like your scene  and I like your brand  but you really must fix these items to get another dollar of my money...  As usual Lucky's Diner was great  but that wasn't enough to save the experience!\"",

I played Roulette with SOAD drummer  John. How sick is that? \\n\\nThe HRH tower suites are very nice. They're spacious and well designed. I could live in the bathroom. There's a huge tub and a separate shower. I've never had an issue with noise  though I've always been in floors that are pretty high up. Although  the pool is sort of loud when they play music. \\n\\nThe staff have always been friendly to me and twice I've been upgraded to a corner suite without asking.",

The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because the bed and pillows were nice. That's about it. I have a very long list of what went wrong for my fun 30th Birthday weekend.\\n\\nFirst  most of the outlets in the room didn't work. There was no lights in the bathroom and the phone didn't work. Also  we had no toilet paper in the room and when we called to have them come fix everything and bring toilet paper. No one ever showed up. I had to go to the front desk and ask them to send us toilet paper. \\n\\nWhen it came time to dine at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast  it took about an hour and a half for our food to come. The customer service in this hotel was so bad. I couldn't believe it.\\n\\nWhen it came time to go to the pool. The first made us get in line with everyone else. Then they told us guest had to use another door. We walked all the way across the casino to be told we had to go back and get wrist bands. Then we did and they wouldn't let us in that door with our bags of sunscreen. We asked the front desk what door hotel guest had to go to and they sent us to do door that was not letting anyone in the pool. Finally we find the right door after about 1 hour of trying to figure it out and by the time we go to the pool there was NO place to sit. They told us we could get a cabana for an additional $500. I asked for the manager and when the pool manager came over  I told him I wanted to speak with the hotel manager and he told me he couldn't call her. I had to get up  walk all the way across the casino again and wait about 30min to speak with her. She did give us $200 towards our cabana  but we still paid $300. I couldn't believe it. Although  Dino at the pool is AMAZING and he was the only one that felt bad about what was going on and took some stress off of us.\\n\\nAll in all  it was very stressful and everyone in my party was getting upset. We spent a good $10 000 on everything there and should never have been treated the way we were treated. \\n\\nI will never stay or even go to this place again  no will I ever use any Hard Rock for work or personal use again. There are much better Hotels in Vegas!",

GET OFF THE FENCE AND CHOOSE A STAR SCHMMAMIT...\\nSo  I settled on a 2.\\nKeep in mind  I think anyone that spends time in their hotel room in Vegas other than the Triple S (shave  shit  shower) combo is beyond words.\\n\\nThe Pros - \\nDecor is top of the line.  Everything in the place is interesting to look at.  Even the elevators have interesting song lyrics on the railing type thing - \\\"\"\"\"Take me down to the paradise city...\\\"\"\"\"  etc.\\nThe beds are like sleeping on a cloud.  They have so much fluff  you almost hate going back to your bed - I said ALMOST...\\nThere are tons of snacks and drinks in the room that  if you don't mind whoring yourself out to pay the extreme costs for  you can enjoy....yeesh!\\nThe view is really cool.  We scoped out the pool scene before heading down so that we could find a spot.\\n\\nThe Cons - \\nThis is the biggest one - Pay Attention....\\nYou are a mile from the strip.  Forget about walking anywhere.  You're going to have to have/rent a car  or pay a cab  etc.  This is a huge....I said HUGE pain in the rear.  You pay a lot for the hotel  the flight out there  the food  etc.  Instead of putting the money into a rental or cabs  just pay a few bucks more and stay on the strip.  You'll thank me later.\\nHonestly  the rest of the cons don't matter.  In my opinion  being so far away from everything was it.  but if you're really interested in things that don't matter...here they are:\\nThere is literally a sign in the mini fridge that reads if you put your personal belongings in there  they won't stay cold.  WHAAAA?  How the hell does that shit work?  So the crap that's in there is cold  but if you put something in  it doesn't get cold?  How does that work?  WTF?  Is there like a heat seeking laser in the back  that seeks foreign warmth and destroys?  \\nThe shower  while interesting to look at  has cracks in the door.  READ - After your shower there is water Effin everywhere!  Think it's fun to drop anchor while you're feet are in water?  Me neither.  Disgusting.\\n\\nAll in all  that stuff doesn't mean a thing.  The main thing is to find a hotel to crash at so that you can go everywhere else.  Hard Rock is great for the stuff there  but if you want to leave  it's like a major project.  That's not even taking into account if you're a dumb ass like me who forgets shit like it's a bodily function.  \\n\\nMy tip is to find a place on the strip and go nuts.\"",

At least they were sincere enough to stick a security guard in front of one garage telling guests the lot was full; we spent an hour and a half in the other garage (HRH) trying to find parking in a sea of traffic going up and coming down the ramps.\\n\\nWhile we were looking for parking  we decided to try to get in touch with a manager to possibly get a refund for the tickets we purchased should we miss the concert. After being transferred several times (reservations  ticketing  security  security manager  front desk  front desk manager) we finally spoke to Sarah  front desk manager- who told us that if we gave the valet attendant her name and presented our concert tickets  that we could valet the car. The valet manager refused and was very snippy and rude when given Sarah's name; even though there were 3 floors dedicated to valet parking in that garage alone  he wouldn't help. When we called Sarah back  she told us that if we weren't so rude to the employees they would have taken care of us but she would insure we were taken care of anyway. When the valet manager once again refused to accept the vehicle  we called Sarah a third time and were told that the valet manager had the final say and she could no longer resolve the situation.\\n\\nI felt as though were were just brushed off at every avenue. I understand the situation with concert guests trying to valet their cars; there is no way they could park every car. At the same time  the guest service was the worst I've ever experienced- especially in Vegas. I'd never been called rude by an employee  ever.\\n\\nI don't feel like I have unreasonable expectations; had we been informed when we were purchasing tickets to expect HEAVY delays we would have better prepared for the parking nightmare and parked somewhere else and taken a cab  had there been security in front of the HRH garage telling guests the lot was full we could have still made the concert had we parked somewhere else and taken a cab  had Sarah stood by her assurance that she would have us taken care of  had Hard Rock prepared overflow parking or not scheduled 3 events an hour apart on one night the situation could have been resolved or never arisen in the first place. \\n\\nI'll be sure to update with the amount of effort it takes to get a refund for the purchase price of the tickets for the event  and the result of my endeavor.\\n\\nEDIT: We were refunded the purchase price of the tickets with the help of LeAnne  but she mentioned that she was only helping us because of how her staff treated us. I definitely won't be patronizing the LV Hard Rock  and doubt we'll be going to others or collecting the HR shot glasses anymore. \\n\\nSomeone needs to inform these people that casual does not equal shitty service.",

We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. \\n\\nCheck-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me  James  was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv  it said their system was down  but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However  the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks  possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. \\n\\nThere are signs all over the casino and hotel that says \\\"\"\"\"no outside food or beverage allowed\\\"\"\"\" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home  but once we ran out of water  we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. \\n\\nThe rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten  it was already about 2am. We were so tired  we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all  it is very close to the airport  so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control  but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also  in the room we had  the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. \\n\\nAlso  the location of this hotel is not amazing. This is a part of vegas that I would NEVER go to alone and I definitely would not recommend leaving the hotel if you decide to stay here. It is not on the strip and it's a further walk from it than you would expect. If you stay here but want to go to other casinos  you better take a cab or have a car. \\n\\nThe only positives about this hotel is the decor and the Joint. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from Hard Rock - modern with a punk influence and the Joint was awesome! A great intimate venue (but the drinks are extremely overpriced - $7 for a very small cheap beer like shocktop - you could buy a whole 6-pack at the CVS across the street for that much!)\\n\\nBasically  just don't stay here unless you're looking to party hard in your hotel and piss everyone on your floor off. The staff doesn't do anything about parties and loud music in the suites. I've had a few friends get suites just to throw parties and you can hear the music all the way down the hall  but staff never said a word to them. They obviously don't care about the customers in suites that are actually trying to get some rest at 3 in the morning.\"",

I will say that I felt their meats/cheeses were outrageously expensive (I compare them to what I can get at Good Food on Montford  which are similarly delicious and you get twice the goods for slightly more than what B&G's charging). I know  I know  quality over quantity...I just don't think I'm enough of a meat/cheese connoisseur to think what they're charging was worth it.

These aren't particularly inventive or crazy sides  you see them (in various forms) on lots of menus...but what set them apart was the execution. They were all just perfection.

Well  this stuff is super hard to track down. After contacting Brave Soldier via internet I learned Box carried it. \\nSince I live in Henderson I called first to make sure they had it in stock. They unfortunately were out until their shipment came in later in the afternoon. They took my number and would call me when they received the shipment. Shortly afterward I got a call back stating that if I was in crucial need of the goods that they had individual 3gram Xela Packs for purchase (among other Brave Soldier product) to hold me over until the shipment came in. I told them I was \\\"\"\"\"on my way\\\"\"\"\"  relief couldn't come quick enough. \\nUpon arrival I found the store easy enough among the other boutique style shops. The decor was really inviting with all of the cool and unique vintage wares. I suggest taking a gander at some of the stuff that isn't for sale also. This place is better than Pinterest for ideas! I was greeted immediately once I walked in even though a previous customer was in the process of checking-out  now-a-days you can't take a simple  kind welcome for granted. Refreshing to say the least after a little bit of a trek across town.\\nNeedless to say I picked up 5 3gram packs of the product and pre-paid for a tube of the ointment once it came in. Their customer service is so on point that they offered to mail me the tube once they received it. Awesome and gas saving! The customer service here thinks outside the box (maybe it's inside the Box)! I suggest picking up some Brave Soldier while visiting even if the present need doesn't exist. You'll eventually need it!\"",

Probably the largest strip club in north carolina... 20 girls tops... WTF? Also  all the girls were covered the entire night. I understand we should work a little for some topless action but these girls made it obvious they weren't going to come to us for money. As the club owner said (he's a bald white/hispanic dude in his 40-50's) black girls are different on tipping and working for money. NO JOKE! Lap dances on the floor are $20 and so are the VIP private dances. So do yourself a favor and request the private dance instead. The girls aren't stuck up but it was just the fact that the club was D-E-A-D! After an hour of blowing money fast  the action stopped. We easily could have thrown another half of our wallets. We expected alot more. Another thing  shower stages all over the club... U-S-E-L-E-S-S! There is no VIP booths. Bottle service is $240 PER BOTTLE. 2 stars for wasted space and dumb ownership.

Or lack there of. We got to the brewery a few minutes before what I was told was our \\\"\"\"\"reservation\\\"\"\"\" time and just shortly after a party of 4 had gotten there. I heard the host tell the party that since they did not have a ''reservation\\\"\"\"\"  it would be about a 30-40 minute wait. The party moved aside to discuss if they wanted to wait or not. The host then ignored my husband and I for 5 minutes while she conversed with 3 other employees all who seemed to not have a care in the world. When we finally got her attention she found our name on the \\\"\"\"\"reservation\\\"\"\"\" list and informed us it would still be at least 30/45 minutes before we could be sat. Now longer than the group who walked in before us that didn't have a \\\"\"\"\"reservation\\\"\"\"\". We have no problem over looking minor service issues especially at a new place  when dining out  but when it comes at the expense of wasting our entire evening  that's just inexcusable. Why bother taking reservations? Scratch that  why email me and ask me if I'd like to have a reservation for your establishment if you have no intention of honoring it. Sure you maybe thinking  \\\"\"\"\"we were going to honor it  just 45 minutes late\\\"\"\"\"... Which means it would take me how long to get food and beer after arriving at this imaginary table? Also 30/45 minutes? Lame. \\n\\nSo I have yet to get a response... \\nForget this small place with crap parking. Go to Fate  or Angels Trumpet  or Sun Up  or Phoenix Ale House  or Sleepy Dog  or Four Peaks  or Gordon Biersch  or hell  drive the hour to Sedona or Pine and visit one of their many breweries.

Our 4 dinners were brought out one at a time  about 5-10 minutes apart.  I watched as server after server wandered around the room asking \\\"\"\"\"did you order...?\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nMy biggest issues here were definitely the problems I don't see them resolving with some simple management.\\n\\n1. I like beer.  I like craft brews and love microbreweries because you can get something completely new.  Not here. I tried every beer they had on tap  except the one they said wasn't ready yet.  The pale ale was decent  but murky and boring. The hefe had a strong vinegar smell  but luckily tasted a little bit better with a strong banana residual flavor.  The James Brown nut ale had the most character  but at the end of the night  was just a nut brown.  The ESB was boring...little flavor and too dark for the style. \\nOverall  I enjoyed the guest taps much more.  The Great Divide saison and the Four Peaks black IPA were much more interesting and worth calling craft beers. \\n\\n2. The food. What a disaster.  I sat with a group of 4.  We ordered their pretzel bread  which I think is just rye bread with pretzel salt on it.  It didn't have much flavor.  The three dips it came with were decent though. I don't eat seafood so the choices for dinner were limited.  There was chicken  burger  bangers and mash  or shepherd's pie.  We ultimately ordered three of these.\\n\\nWhich all came out about 5-10 minutes apart.\\n\\nThe chicken was a drumstick and thigh on about 3/4 cup rice.  VERY salty and mostly just a teriyaki taste. The bangers and mash are one sausage on lumpy mashed potatoes. The shepherd's pie was good  all six bites of it. The burger was forgotten about and reordered.  It came out rare  not medium-well as ordered.  It was ok  but I've had much better burgers that didn't cost $14.\\n\\nOverall  I would eat before you go  and be willing to know that any beer you get here you can get pretty much anywhere else.  Until they get more creative with beers  and reasonable with thier food prices/portions we will not be going again.  \\n\\nWhat a shame.\"",

I balked at the price  quickly decided I would do the repair myself to save a bit.\\n-Lie #1: \\\"\"\"\"Your rear blower motor is shot\\\"\"\"\"\\n-Lie #2: \\\"\"\"\"We removed the rear panel an tested  there is power going to the rear motor\\\"\"\"\"\\n-Lie #3: When I balked at the price  they \\\"\"\"\"realized\\\"\"\"\" they had mistakenly quoted me double the price for a new blower motor. \\n-Lie #4: Was quoted 4 hours of labor to remove and replace the rear blower motor (at $150 per hour) (Ok Not technically a lie  just an overinflated estimate supposedly directly from Nissan  it took me about 2 hours to do it with improper tools. I I had to do it again it would take 1 hour)\\nSo I purchased a new blower motor online  took the car part  installed the new one  to my surprise it did not fix the problem. I then tested the motor I took out  worked perfectly  and tested the connection  there's no power going the the motor! \\nI'm convinced they got busy and just quoted me the most expensive possible fix  if I agreed then they would actually figure out the real problem. (And still charge me the full price of course) I'm not sure what other explanation there could be?! The mechanic even told me to my face exactly what he tested  and it was complete lies!\\nI then took it to a different nissan dealer  explained what haopened  which diagnosed it correctly. I bought the part online and fixed it myself for a total of $5.00  the plastic had broken inside one of the knobs that controls the A/C  and it now works perfectly. \\nOne last note very peculiar note: I dropped off the vehicle initially  my FRONT a/c worked perfectly. I picked up the vehicle from Coulter Nissan  and my FRONT A/C motor died on the way home (I live 2 miles away) I did take it back and discussed this with them  and gave them the benefit of the doubt and chalked that up to a nearly impossible coincidence  but since learning the rest of the story  I just don't know. \\nDon't trust this dealer to ever work on your vehicle. Even if they correctly diagnose a problem  (which they wont) their labor estimates are inflated 400% over how long they actually take. \\nI tell you what  loan me a GTR for a week and we'll call it even  you know who I am. Aside from that  I will not be back  and likely never go to any nissan dealer anywhere ever again.\\nHonesty... Is it really so freaking hard?!\"",

It just didn't stack up on its own or compared to other local bakeries. \\n\\nI might be missing something but this is not the amazing cupcake place/bakery it's hyped up to be. I will start with the Pros  the decor is cute a little overdone but cute. \\nService was pleasant and friendly they had a sour apple sample which we tried  it tasted like a green jolly rancher  was lime green in color and left an after taste. \\n\\nCupcakes. We ordered the carrot cake cupcake with an orange frosting  the strawberry cupcake  the chocolate with peanut butter and the chocolate with salted caramel. The carrot cake was really dense and the frosting was reminiscent of orange flavoring you know like Tang. The strawberry had no flavor and didn't taste like strawberry however it was a hot red color which was slightly off putting considering all the dye used to probably achieve that color. The chocolate cupcake was redeeming but it wasn't amazing just Ok. The frosting again however was just not good  the intensity of the flavors leave a strange after taste in your mouth. \\n\\nThe macaroons - I feel bad reviewing them but they sell them and we bought them so here goes. We had two flavors the green apple and the salted caramel. Texture: not a macaroon at all  they are hard and not airy like the usual macaroon. Flavors were off. They actual remind me of a shortbread cookie with icing between them. As small as they are we  didn't even eat finish them. 2.50 or 2.75 +/- for one  I can't remember exactly but that's crazy for how bad they were.",

Music was really loud  but it was a Friday night so I get if they were trying to keep up with Blue Martini across the way. I was surprised at how busy it was when I walked in but then excited about the people watching. It's a neat  small space. \\n\\nThe host was great. Very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nI finally found a couple of seats at the bar and ordered a couple of the specialty drinks on the menu when I girlfriend arrived. She got the yoga marg and I got some blanco drink with grapefruit. The drinks were tasty  but the bartender was saltier than the rim of my glass. We immediately were taken back by her passiveness and abrupt responses to our questions about the menu. (Which consisted of one question- street tacos are three to an order. Do we pick three or is it three of the same). \\n\\nAnyhow  my girlfriend had a shard of glass shoot through her straw into her mouth. Not upset about it  it happens. I worked in the industry for years so hey  you burn the ice  make new drinks and apologize. No such luck. We told the bar back  he alerted the bartender  she got irritated. He had to convince to to make a new drink. She made hers  set it down and walked away. No apology  no words even. I grabbed the bar back and said  \\\"\"\"\"I hate to be a pain in the a*$ but the waters and my drink came from the same well. We need these remade too if you could. \\\"\"\"\". He was totally on board but this irritated her further. She made the drinks and never burned a well. I asked her if the drinks came from the same one and her response  three times  was  \\\"\"\"\"I promise... You're good.\\\"\"\"\"  Never  it came from a different well; im sorry that happened; let me check; is your friend ok... After twenty minutes I grabbed a manager to let her know that there was ice in one of the wells because I watched to see neither get burned and somebody was going to end up chewing on more glass. The manager immediately dealt with the bar and we never saw our bartender again.  Until she threw the check down. \\n\\nI'll give credit on the place  the food was ok and the atmosphere made up for it. That bartender though made us never want to go back. Before any of this happened  we had tried to make up an excuse to sit on the other end of the bar to avoid her attitude.  \\n\\nI've been in the industry for a long time and have had yelp reviews written about me. Some good. Some bad. You can't win em all. You can  however  be nice to people  even when you're busy  and let the chips fall where they may.  Unfortunately she chose to play her cards horribly.

They do have plenty of bars spread around so that in itself gets a star. \\n\\nSpeaking of that  after i bought a drink from the bar on the right corner  I turned my head to see a what seemed like a 200+ lb black guy swapping mad spit with a skinny little white guy and grabbing each others...ugh wtf!!

        "text": "\"Before we even got inside:\\nCame here opening weekend (4/27/13) to see Calvin Harris. My group was 5 girls total and we were on a guestlist and were told that our entry would be free. We arrived around 10:15 and pointed to the guestlist line which was so long it was out the door and around the corner of the hotel outside. My group waited a total of 2.5 hours to get inside and once we did we were told at the payment windows that they had \\\"\"\"\"just changed the rules for the guestlist a few minutes ago\\\"\"\"\" and now it was $20 for girls and $200 for guys. Are you kidding me? I know it was opening weekend and they were busy  but trying to milk it the way they did was ridiculous.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving the extra star is for the awesome female host (I wish I could remember her name  she was blonde and had her hair in a top-bun) that was understanding of our situation and helped us out by giving us a different guestlist entry slip that allowed us to all get in free like we were supposed to originally. She was incredibly nice to do that for us and was one of the few kind staff members we encountered in Vegas all weekend.\\n\\nInside:\\nWe walked inside right as Calvin Harris started his set and tried to make our way to the dance floor. The place was so packed that they had blocked off the dance floor so that no one else was allowed in. Whatever  that happens with popular DJs  but there was literally NO WHERE else to stand. Anywhere we stopped  we were motioned by bouncers to keep moving.\\n\\nWe decided to try going upstairs to the upper level to see if we had more luck up there so we went to the elevators to go up and were told that the elevators were for \\\"\"\"\"VIP use only\\\"\"\"\". Wtf? Okay  so after about 10 minutes  we locate where the stairs are and go up. It was considerably more roomy up there  but there were so many tables (most of them empty) that there was NO WHERE to stand to see the stage. Once more people started making their way up there  we were again told that we couldn't stand behind the bottle service tables. We ended up doing laps around the club! It was ridiculous!\\n\\nAll in all we probably only spent 30 minutes there because we were so miserable. Not even Calvin Harris's great set could keep us there longer. Maybe in a few weeks when the hype dies down and there isn't so many people it might be better  but it did not leave a good first impression and getting my friends to ever go back is going to be impossible.\\n\\nPros: Not many. Good DJ's and the one great staff member we spoke to.\\n\\nCons: Too many stairs  horrible use of space  way too many bottle service tables (most of which were not even in use) allowing no where to stand if you didn't drop 10k on a table  skeezy practices when it came to charging people who were told they were getting in free  etc  etc. I will most likely not be going back any time soon.\"",

They followed my homie around the whole night but he didn't do anything wrong so they didn't kick him out. They are pretty much useless ass bouncers with nothing better to do.

First off  for so many stairs to walk around  I understand why there are absolutely NO places to sit down/rest (unless you have table service) Even when my friends and I managed to find an area to chill or to take off our heels  there are guards on your case to wear your shoes and back on the dance floor...

It was so hot and crowded and stuffy that I became light headed. Eventually I had to leave the club to get some air  but oh yah  NO IN AND OUT'S. \\n\\n- SUPER CROWDED: I mean yah  all clubs are gonna be crowded in vegas. But like I said above  THERE'S NO DANCE ROOM BECAUSE THE DANCEFLOOR IS SO SMALL!!! Seriously. Aren't you supposed to dance at a club?? HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WHEN THE DANCE FLOOR IS SO SMALL???\\n\\n- SERVICE: people here are just not nice. Bouncers are unreasonble and mean. \\n\\nHonestly  my review is not biased whatsoever. I've given this club a second chance and a third chance. But my opinion still stands  and not only mine. Almost everyone I've talked to doesn't like Hakkasan. Definitely my least favorite club on the strip.",

Cant really remember much of the drink prices because i inly bought one since i showed up already faded. Love the music only down side i would say not much wiggle room but cant expect much out of a packed night when theres a dj that everybody wants to see.

        "text": "\"Now that I am flying back home to Miami  here is my full review on Hakkasan...\\n\\nTHE LINE... \\n\\nFirst  if you get in a \\\"\"\"\"VIP Guest List\\\"\"\"\" and are told to simply go up and tell them you are on it  they will put you in a long ass line that was at least 800 people deep.  We went on Thursday  July 3rd - it was not a Ti\\u00ebsto night. When we got in line (about 10:35pm)  it wrapped out to one of the doors near some restrooms - total time in line to get to the people actually checking the guest list ~1 hour.... Your ID *will* be checked - depending on how young you look  maybe a few times. Saw someone kicked out of line for having an expired DL too  so make sure you have a good one!  There were people in line with tickets for the night ($30)... So  that doesn't get you in any faster FYI. \\n\\nDRESS CODE...\\n\\nGuys... There is a sign that states \\\"\"\"\"dress code strictly enforced.\\\"\"\"\"  I knew I was good... Figure if i can dress appropriately  everyone else should  right? WRONG! There were guys in line that got in wearing cheap solid color t-shirts  sleeveless t-shirts  and even tank tops. A few got in wearing polo shirts (borderline for a \\\"\"\"\"high end\\\"\"\"\" club if you ask me).  Guys - wear a button-down shirt for goodness sakes!  Ladies were mostly dressed appropriately for the scene - but  I haven't been to many clubs where the ladies do not know how to dress. \\n\\nGETTING INSIDE...\\n\\nAfter you are \\\"\"\"\"checked off\\\"\"\"\" the guest list  you approach another (final) ID check. Your wrist is stamped a second time and you are ushered to the register to pay to get in. Yes  we were on the guest list and didn't have to pay that night - the people that check you off earlier in line  issue you a \\\"\"\"\"pass\\\"\"\"\" telling the cashier how many males vs. females in your party.  You turn in that paper are handed a receipt  and then ushered into a bank of elevators which they pack shoulder to shoulder... Ugh! \\n\\nONCE INSIDE...\\n\\nThe elevator doors opened on the 4th floor and in you go to a hallway leading up a couple of stairs to the dance area. The first thing I noticed is the relatively small (read - packed) dance floor.  The dance area is surrounded by VIP tables/booths. There are a few bars around the outskirts of the floor/VIP area. As for decor  well... I think a friend put it best in reaction to a video I posted on Instagram... It looks like a black box with lights inside!\\n\\nIf you are not a smoker  beware - you will get smoke in your face in this place. Sometimes you are walking along and poof! you walk into a cloud of smoke thanks to another patron. \\n\\nWe also explored the 5th floor  figuring one could look down on the dance floor below and see the DJ  etc. Another disappointment here... Once you get upstairs  the only way to look down on the floor and see the DJ  is if you have one of the VIP tables/booths up there. Otherwise  you are at least 6-8' back from the overlook and can't see anything really. \\n\\nBAR...\\n\\nIt's Vegas  so I figured it would be around $14-16 for a drink here. Ordered 2 goose with pineapple = $40 including tip.  The \\\"\"\"\"glass\\\"\"\"\" tumbler is plastic (I've been to \\\"\"\"\"cheaper\\\"\"\"\" clubs and they serve in actual glass - guess this place \\\"\"\"\"can't afford\\\"\"\"\" the glass???  As for the alcohol to mixer content - I would say it was average. Not terrible  but not $20 worth in my book. \\n\\nBATHROOM...\\n\\nYou would think that a place the size of this one would have a decent restroom facility. I am sad to say that NO  it doesn't - at least the one I went to.  Once you get inside the bathroom  an attendant pretty much keeps things in check and\\\"\"\"\"assigns\\\"\"\"\" you a urinal or stall based on availability... Sound great  except that there were only 3 urinals and two stall that I remember seeing. Once done  the attendants are extremely courteous and do their job really well - tip them  as it may be the only thing that actually worked well!\\n\\nOVERALL...\\n\\nI would NOT go again  unless there is a special event going on where I know I will see a favorite DJ. Even then  I would be hard pressed to pay for a ticket or be on a VIP guest list. The only way to do this place right is probably to get a table  and from what I understood is definitely in the thousand$. \\n\\nCan't wait to get back to Miami to go to a real nightclub!\"",

He had a military style backpack that was also black. He stood in the middle of the theater for over a minute looking around.

I mentioned to the attendant that we had been waiting about 10 minutes and that it would be nice if he would take us first as we would be late for our movie.  Instead of accommodating us  he turned to the gentleman that had just walked up and said  is it okay if I take them.  The man did not answer.  So the attendant told us 'no'.  I walked back to the center and continued waiting.  If this wasn't bad enough  the two attendants working directly in front of us just walked off without telling us they were going somewhere.

In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's  many people aren't aware that on Sunday  Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe  Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady  but never feels stuffy  especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet  the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains  which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. \\n\\nOutside of the fountains  the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive  but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here  with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet  the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar  a selection of caviar and sushi  and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station  but a better choice is the soup  where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef  lamb  and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai  short ribs  crystal prawns. Best of all  they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \\n\\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts  and unlike many buffets  these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally  the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts  what was particularly good that day  and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \\n\\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish)  and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines  and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically  but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \\n\\nOverall  this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations  go hungry  and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else  this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip.",

They boast about having a (out of 2 in Edinburgh) Josper Grill. \\nThis is like cooking an charcoal barbecue  indoors. \\n\\nWe were previously unaware that this place existed and after finding a dining voucher online for a steak main   sauce and sides. \\n\\nOn arrival they were very pleasant an courteous. Took our coats and bags. \\nWe were asked to choose which table we wanted. The place is small (20 covers max). The wall were covered in dark brown textured wallpaper. The lighting was minimal  but well placed. It oozes class and sophistication. \\n\\nWe were duly introduced to the menu  the specials and  the missing  / replacement dishes. The wine list was small but well sourced. I also liked the fact that they had 9 wines by the glass (3 red  3 white  2 rose  1 prosecco) \\nThe bread was served with oil & vinegar dip and 3 kinds of butter  one of which was a very tasty hazelnut butter. \\n\\nafter ordering we got served an amuse bouche of josper grilled fillet steak & celeriac foam. That. Was. Delicious.\\n\\nWe decided to share a starter. We selected the Lobster Tarragon Ravioli with Thermidor sauce. Very tasty and outstanding  though possibly a little thick on the edges.  It went well with their prosecco. \\n\\nFor main we had the same: Rib-Eye steak Medium-Rare  with Green Pepper & 12yo Scotch sauce  Skinny Fries and a side of Bone Marrow.\\nwe asked for mayonnaise  however they didn't have that so they suggested to use a Bearnaise sauce for our fries - interesting yet tasty alternative.\\nMy steak was cooked slightly rarer than I would have liked  but it was good. \\nYes 'good' - not 'wow'  'outstanding' or 'fantastic'. Good. Definitely in my top 3 for a good steak. Missing was the charcoal flavour (like we had on the amuse bouche fillet) it was possibly too subtle  same issue with the sauce  again I like my flavours a little bolder and this was again slightly too delicate. I am sure the chefs are very accomplished  as you could tell by the way all was presented and prepared. \\n\\nWe had some espressos afterwards. \\n\\nIt took a while for our bill to be presented and in turn trying to pay - they did apologise for that.. \\n\\nIn all this was a very successful date-night!",

I may try it again with meat sauce  but I am not sure  because it seems self-defeating in a veggie dish.\\n\\nThe newest item I tried was the  Chicken Chimichurri Wrap.  Very straight forward and tasty.  The sauce is a mixture of a spicy red sauce & chimichurri.  Fair warning to those sensitive to heat: this item is fairlyy hot (5/6 out of 10 on my random heat scale).  Though I liked it and it was tasty  it was a 3 ingredient dish  chicken  wrap  & sauce.  It was served with a few little  whole pickles on the side.  I think the flavor of the pickles actually masked the flavor of the wrap  so I didn't eat them all.\\n\\nLastly  the loaded oatmeal cookie and loaded it is! Chocolate  cherries  coconut  & seeds fortify the standard oatmeal.  There's lots going on in this cookie and one of the best cookies I have had lately.\\n\\nThe speed of food isn't supremely quick  but I don't have a problem because of the high food quality.

The Duchess of The Cholas Tanja R was very convincing that I (as non enthousiast of Indian Food) would find this place as wonderful as she does. Especially the dosas.\\n\\nAnita A. called ahead to advise we were bringing our own dessert - which was no problem (+1 Star)\\n\\nSo in a group of 6 we arrived at around 19:30 (you see where this is going - as I mention an arrival time) We were seated and I took a good look around the place. \\n\\nAn elongated place with dark wooden tables on either side  and a dispensing bar/order section in the back on the way to the kitchen.\\nI was hoping to elaborate on the atmosphere  but there was none. No decoration of note - OK I lied  they used those shiny metallic wrapping stars you use on presents.. on the wall.. about 8 of them evenly spaced over the place. \\n\\nThe table decoration was nicely done with the actual only bright colour in the place. Tanja R was warmly greeted by the owner / manager and was assured tonight was going to be a blast! \\n\\nThat was a serious overstatement. \\nI will not go in to many details but I mentioned the time of arrival and after ordering (he made a really clear show of repeating every ordered dish back to us)  and awaiting our starters   we eventually got our starters at 20:45 WTaF?!  - We became a bit worried about what and why it took so long. As they kept forgetting water we asked for twice  and my beer had to be reordered too. \\nEvident ally they were busy. However a table of 3 that arrived about half hour after us got starters at the same time as us! \\n\\nI was again assured by Menno V. Tanja R. and Anita A. that they had just recently opened and this is just unusual - however that statement was on shaky ground. When the main courses arrived (fairly swift after the starters) they managed to not serve mine.. I got the rice  but no main. I shared the meal of others. We did ask where my meal was an he said he was going to check and reorder. However we were thus far that all of the other diners already finished and my rice was also about gone - we cancelled my main meal  my birthday meal! Not impressed. I had to eat from other plates to have a meal on my birthday.. seriously. \\nFair does to the taste though as all the food we did have was very flavourful. (+1 Star) But it would have been nice to actually have my own meal. \\nThe Tiramisu that Anita made was very nice. \\n\\nLittle in apologies was supplied and they actually put the missing dish on the bill.. at this point I started doubting the previous rating for Cholas of my fellow diners who even at this point still half heartily defended the place. \\n\\nAnother disappointment was the toilet. Beside not being very clean  I was just washing my hands and hand dryer didn't work. (Yes Menno V. I did try to use the on switch) No paper towels  so I resorted to toilet paper  and the holder fell off the wall and onto the floor.. I tried placing it back. Didn't fit. Afterwards when going again it was back in place and at the first tuck it fell off again. \\n\\nSo they kept telling that this place just opened and they are usually not busy. Well when 5 star reviews are set you better get used to being busy. And now with the fringe in town - people will look for good places to eat and look at that all important star rating. \\n\\nEven Tanja R & Anita A had to advise the owner/manager that they will have to avoid going here during the Fringe as they are not looking to repeat this experience. \\n\\nIf they don't get their act together  my  review may not be the only one of its kind  but many more will follow!\\n\\nI was so disappointed that due to all this waiting to get food - the whole evening was about over when we finished eating and we were too tired  too full (and miffed) to do anything else - well I did anyway. So home wards it was. \\n\\nIt should've been so nice - and I was pleased to have my good friends with me. But any other place would've likely been a better experience.",

And when the chef came out front to talk to other patrons about how he was going to repaint & spruce the place up  I was glad. He never stopped at our table to say hello or introduce himself even though we were the only other diners in the place. While I found that to be a bit offputting  I'm glad I didn't let it spoil my experience because...\\n\\nTHE FOOD WAS AMAZING. Gorgeous presentation  amazing flavors  fun textures. Everything was designed to please all of your senses AND make your taste buds come alive. \\nMy friends & I did the tasting menu for $89 a person. Two vegetarian & two regular. They brought out a total of 10 courses & I'm not kidding - every single thing was to die for. I'm very picky & wouldn't rave about the food unless it was worthy. The veggie tasting menu looked incredible & I was jealous I didn't get to try some of those options as well!\\n\\nWe started off the meal with a complimentary glass of lemon seltzer & crushed raspberries - to open up our palates. We also had ordered a few drinks from the bar - which were fabulous. The Ginger Julep was a favorite. The wonderful wait staff then proceeded to bring out our dishes in a perfectly timed fashion. Some of my dishes included lobster & some kind of apple concotion with caviar  beef tartare with kiwi & nuts on top & lettuce cups to wrap them in  crab in a flavorful broth and... ok I really stink at describing the food  lol. I can't remember what everything was but each dish was complex. Masterfully combined flavors  textures & colors. The food was so beautiful  we hardly wanted to eat it (but we did!). I wish I could give more thorough descriptions but it was amazing. We had several dessert courses & the best was a cheesecake \\\"\"\"\"pudding\\\"\"\"\"  covered in freshly sliced cherries  a japanese herb whose name escapes me & some edible flowers on top. I could have eaten 10 of those! We were also given homemade chocolate truffles after dinner. \\n\\nThis is not a place you go to if you want to stuff yourself with typical American fare (not that there's anything wrong with a burger & fries!). You don't go here if you want to spend $10 & do an all-you-can-eat thing. When I see peopel complaining about portion size or price - it's obvious they didn't do any research into this restaurant before choosing to dine here. The food is complex  fun  delicious & truly unique. It's an experience. It's expensive for Pittsburgh but in NYC  a restaurant like this would charge $200+ for the same tasting menu. If you can go here for a romantic night or a special occasion  I simply can't recommend it enough. \\nI will be back the next time I have a special occasion to celebrate\"",

It looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.\\n\\nWhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing.

I say 'staff' because although we really had one waiter  people were stopping by constantly to see how we were  and if we needed anything.  They were beyond familiar with the menu and they talked to us about the food as if they were each aspiring chefs / owners of their own gourmet burger joints.  They were enthusiastic about the food and made great recommendations.\\n \\nWe started out with the Nom Nom Calamari  which despite being kinda run of the mill squid  is prepared in such a way that they blow your socks off!  Between the prepeation and Sweet Thai Chili sauce  they're amazing!  Ours were very spicy  so be careful if that isn't your thing.   We also had a half-dozen Bonzai wings.  These wings were incredible!  And with appetizers around $5 or $6 dollars each  you should just get a few for the table.  The more the merrier!!    \\n\\nWhen it came time for the main course  I had the Black & Blue Burger (medium-rare) with Shimp chips  and my girfriend had the Nom Nom Burger (well done) with french fries.  I wasn't in love with the Shrimp chips.  But  I suspect that I blasted my taste buds on the double appetizer.  The burgers were each cooked PRECISELY how we requested them  and when I say that mine was just about the best burger I've had in Charlotte  I mean it.  You simply can't write a review that describes how flavorful it was  so  I won't.\\n\\nWhen we were done  the ower came out to greet us and thank us for coming.  I was so blown away I kept thanking him.  So  between the bangin' food  AMAZING staff  and amazingly friendly prices  I recomment you go to this place immediately!    \\n\\nI know this is a long review  so I'll end it with this:  I often pass by The Liberty Restraunt on South Blvd which has the sign that reads  'Charlotte's best burger.'

I wanted to try this place out for myself. I didn't want a sandwich  I was craving something lighter like soup and hummus  so that's exactly what I ordered... \\n\\nChili: very bland  overpowered by large pinches of cumin. Very meaty  which was nice  but was disappointed that it didn't come with a side of cornbread or some sort of bread. \\nHummus: also pretty bland and comes with side of pita  which I used some for the chili. I wasn't super impressed  I would recommend maybe a variety of veggies to accompany it. \\n\\nPerhaps it was just a poor choice of food that I ordered  but then again  if this place is that good  anything ordered should be delicious. I'll definitely give this place another try  maybe this time a nice salad or a scrumptious sandwich... Even now as I'm multitasking by eating and texting this review  I can't seem to enjoy my order.  Sorry  but this chili sucks!!!",

I must say that Binkley is starting to read his market or perhaps sees that the new is starting to wear off his \\\"\"\"\"fine dining\\\"\"\"\" concept. Here  he seems to be trying to get it right. There are enough freakish things on the menu such as roasted marrow bone (gag!) and he's big on mussels. This is Arizona. I've had mussels out of the water in Nova Scotia and this is just too far away. I want to keep on living. No thanks.\\n\\nThose items aside  Bink's is making a stab at reasonable prices and food that is creative yet non-freakish and non-threatening. He can keep the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. That's not food. That's what food eats. \\n\\nBink's hits the need for lunch and happy hour and in these areas he does pretty well. Portions are small as at any Bink's place but decent. He makes a good but not a great burger. Salads are really  really fresh with good accompaniments and dressings. The happy hour menu is very reasonable and can serve as a sufficient early dinner. His express lunch concept is to offer two broad categories with three selections within each and he promises you will be in and out in 30 minutes and he delivers on this. Express Lunch is $15 and you're done. Still kind of an expensive fast lunch but not bad to treat one's self. \\n\\nI still think he has a long way to go in order to leave behind the freaky menu of his anchor restaurant in Carefree but he is making a gallant effort to offer food that people have heard of without being strange just for the sake of being strange or avoiding comparison with other restaurants. This will never be a favorite of mine but I am glad I let myself be dragged there to see that Binkley is at least trying to accommodate the local market and not just well-heeled snowbirds who apparently will eat anything at any price.\"",

The driver\\ngave a warning that the bus would depart in 10\\nminutes however seemed to cut this short and started to\\nmove the bus-he wouldn't open the door to let\\nmy husband back on-arguing that he's on a\\ntight schedule. I think he was in a hurry to get \\noff his shift.  Seems doing a little thing could've\\nwent a long way. My husband had to wait 3 hours\\nfor the next bus and megabus has some pretty\\ncrappy stations-nothing around  dead areas and\\nno amenities-not too great or safe to be late at night.\\nThe driver also had a real attitude-like I said\\na little humanity could've gone a long way.",

So last night I was in a spur of the moment mood and called to place an order to go. When I got there at 6 pm the place was totally empty  I thought uh oh I hope that's not an indication of inferior tasting food. Lechon  albeit the skin was crispy  the taste just wasn't there or I should say it's NOT what a normal lechon from Cebu tastes like. It needed more spices and I didn't detect the smell and taste of lemongrass which I think is a huge part of the flavor. The pork steamed rice wasn't good at all. It was too sweet and the texture was off. I really wanted to like this place so I'm very disappointed  but who knows maybe one day I might just try their other offerings.",

The patios are beautiful  amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger  and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.\\n\\nI'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened  I had a number of great dining experoences  but recently the service here has been  for the most part  mediocre if not outright nonexistent. \\n\\nIn most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes  no smiles  and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow  and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed. \\n\\nI understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings  and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.\\n\\nI was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends  but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister  and had even eaten inside  I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier  she broke in before I could even finish to say \\\"\"\"\"that was me  and I can't seat you.\\\"\"\"\" Taken aback  I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left  she mumbled \\\"\"\"\"Have a nice day.\\\"\"\"\" All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.\\n\\nI was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone  but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.\\n\\nI'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said  the food is good  but I'm not a fan of the \\\"\"\"\"exclusive  you're-not-worth-our-time  cool-kids only\\\"\"\"\" vibe the employees have been giving me.

Choice Hotels corporate sent me a joke of an apology letter that did nothing for me nor did it even address my situation - clearly a form letter which is rather insulting.  After playing phone tag with the Downtown Grand for a while  Sarah gave me the option of rescheduling my stay for another time up to July 2015  which is 1-year after I made the reservation.  Unfortunately that also does nothing for me  because I can't get out to Vegas by then.  \\n\\nSO...at the end of the day the Downtown Grand is keeping my $400+ bucks  and I'm getting nothing  which leaves my evaluation at 1-star.  Appreciate the effort from Sarah  but it doesn't go far enough.  Was really hoping for a full refund or at least a partial refund  say all but $100.  \\n\\nFYI - my 4 buddies that I go to Vegas with every year at this time are also incensed about this.  We usually get pizza at the Downtown Grand's pizza restaurant for lunch 1 day during our trip  and they were considering staying at the hotel this time as well.  Well  the restaurant is now off the rotation and they did not reserve their rooms at the Downtown Grand  due entirely to what happened to me.  \\n\\nHope the Downtown Grand's loss of a couple of thousand dollars of business from us every year was worth the $400+ of mine.",

We are told it would be close to a 2 hour wait for a table for two  but sitting at the bar would be quicker.  We agreed  but quickly changed our minds when we realized everyone at the bar were working on their salad course.  I was not about to stand around and wait  especially as the smell of the restaurant was making me kinda sick.  We checked Yelp again and headed to Solo Trattoria.  \\n\\nSolo Trattoria is well hidden in the Esplanade Center off Camelback and 25th Street.  Parking is plentiful in the garage but be prepared to pay to park.  I did overhear our server tell another table that the restaurant validates parking  but of course  I left my ticket in the car and did not want to walk back to get it.  \\n\\nOnce we found the restaurant  we were pleased.  It is beautiful.  We were greeted and after some confusion on where to seat us  we were seated in the main dining room.  \\n\\nAfter looking at the menu  we asked to start with the meatball starter ($9) as It was recommended by our server.  The meatballs were five star for sure  3 big meatballs in a fantastic tomato sauce.  I probably could have ordered two servings of those and called it dinner.  We also ordered a couple of Sangrias ($8ea) and then our main courses  chicken piccata ($20) and chicken marsala ($22)  If I had a complaint was the pasta was a bit too al dente  but it is made fresh and sometimes fresh pasta can taste this way.  Speaking of fresh  the owner stopped by our table to let us know that everything in the restaurant was made from scratch except for the bread as that is brought in from a local bakery.  \\n\\nSo  we do want to return and definitely get the meatballs again.

I can't say enough how ecstatic I am that I was referred to Dr. Becky.",

Josh was extremely helpful when my gun jammed a couple of times.  Very very very helpful and all about SAFETY.  I appreciate everyone there and the free cleaning with the range time.  Ladies Night is Thursday night.  The thing I liked is that even though I am a female they didn't make me feel stupid when I asked a question.  The only thing I didn't like was that the shooting stall walls didn't go to the ceiling and other peoples shell casings were coming over the wall and hit me in the head and distracted me and a few burned my arm but that's not their fault I will just choose my location differently next time.   Wish they were open a little later for those of us who work Monday - Friday...........  So overall Fantastic!   Thanks to the Team at Green Valley Range for making my friend and I feel so welcome.",

My husband got a Groupon and thought we would try another Chinese place. You walk in and wonder if this place is a Chinese restaurant or a bar? It's a bar that serves terrible Chinese food. I completely agree with Tom M. It was the WORST tasting Chinese food ever! The place is dirty and toilets don't flush. They tell you to seat yourself when you walk in. The waitress seemed like she was on drugs. We would ask about certain food and she didn't know what to say about it. There were 4 kids (about 10-12 years old) playing with the pool table and throwing darts and hitting everything but the dart board. The employees nor the parents cared that the kids were running around screaming and being obnoxious. \\n\\nNow for the food  the only thing worth eating was the War Wonton soup. However  there was only three tasteless shrimps in two bowls of soup and we paid $10.00 for it. We got one order of Mongolian chicken. We usually get two when we go anywhere else  but since it was our first time there we decided to check it out first. We were so glad we did. It was so disgusting and where was the chicken? We got a heaping plate of onions and green chives. I had two bites and I was done. My husband looked for the chicken and ate the few pieces he found. I ordered two vegetarian egg/spring rolls. It was greasy and mushy on the inside. I had one bite and that was it. There was no filler like you would find in a regular egg roll. Oh  and the white rice. How can you go wrong with that???? Well  it was not like regular white rice. It was very small and sticky. I had maybe 5 bites. If you want soy sauce you can find the to-go packets. There is no bottle of soy sauce. We stuck with water  so that was safe...I think.\\n\\nWhen we were ready to go  I had to find the waitress. She forgot to take the Groupon off the bill  so we had to wait for that too. We left hungry  disappointed  and with a stomachache. It's also not good if you have acid reflux.  \\n\\nSo  if you want to go to a bar that looks scary and dirty  serves the worst Chinese food ever  gives you a stomachache  has horrible service and allows young kids to run around throwing darts and screaming  then this is the place to go! \\n\\nWhat a waste of time and money. You couldn't pay me enough to go back there...EVER! We are sticking with Flo's!!!",

The driver finally called me at 11:48 am and said he just got the dispatch and was heading over from the strip and would need 15-20 minutes to arrive at my destination. Not only was the driver late  but he was incredibly rude on the phone. I asked if there was anything he could do since by the time he arrived I would miss my flight and he only kept repeating: \\\"\"\"\"Do you want me to come or not?\\\"\"\"\" As you can guess  I missed my flight. \\n\\nI would never use this cab company again.\"",

My friend comes here and recommended it so I came in. \\nSimilar to other experiences we went to the nail bar and I had a gentleman ask what service I wanted and like usual  I asked for a gel manicure. He filed the top of my nails then quickly asked another woman to come over and do them. My friend even joked with him that he must hate doing gel nails to which he laughed. She was nice and conversational. They offered me wine which was a nice perk after work. After some talk with the nail technicians and choosing a color  we discussed why it was so difficult to get my last polish off (had them done somewhere else). She commented that some gel polish is better than others and held up the color I choose and said mine was easier to remove than say...OPI. She wasn't kidding. I got a chip in my thumb polish the day after and now  one week after  three of my nails have size-able chips in them (she did 3 coats). I've never had gel chip so easily and have so many tiny air bubbles. \\n\\nWould recommend for a quick  basic manicure or polish change because they are efficient and polite. There were a few hiccups in customer service. They didn't mention until after services and while I was paying that they take cash tips only which I don't remember seeing posted anywhere and definitely wasn't mentioned before or during service.

They do some more restaurant/dinner type entrees throughout the week as well. I would not say their wings are the best in da 'Burgh  but they are pretty good.\\n\\nThey recently revamped their menu and increased their prices(having worked in the restaurant industry for many years I understand the need to do this)  but it seems they took off some our favorite items. For that I have to give it 4 stars.\\n\\nThey have a great outdoor seating area which is open almost year round. Others have complained about the loud music. I would agree. The music can be loud  but its  a bar folks!! If you want to watch the Pens  Steelers or Pirates play  you certainly can. Sit in the bar area and the volume is usually pretty loud.\\n\\nThey have a nice dining room for a bar too. You can request to sit in the far back room if its a more quite atmosphere in which you seek.\\n\\nI recommend the chicken quesodilla or a burger. Just watch out  its build your own burger and they charge for each topping  but please  don't bark about the price.

If you are standing on the 21+ side  there are several obnoxious blinding lights shining down on you  making it even harder to see the stage  also killing any kid of enjoyable atmosphere.\\nMeanwhile in the bathroom  there was one drunk girl passed out on a couch and another throwing up in the stall. Both paper towel machines were broken. The security guards were standing around the bathroom (it's one of those community washrooms)  watching me touch up my make-up  giving me thumbs up. Awkward. \\nThere was a drunk guy stumbling around bleeding from his face. He was kicked out  but then let back in 20 minutes later.

Completely startled we all glance at each other wondering if that really just happened. Followed by 2 other moms I walk to the room  concerned. When i asked Coach Shauna what was wrong she told me that the girls were just not listening. I told her that if she ever has a problem with my daughter to send her out of class  that i am always in the other room and that i do not approve of her yelling at her. the other mothers also voiced their concern in which Coach Shauna replied &quot;if you dont want your kid in my class they don't have to be&quot; Hello?! Last I knew I payed to have my kid in this class and never once did I sign her up to be disciplined especially in that manner! After requesting to speak with the manager about the incident and them returning my call after they reviewed the tape i was informed that they cant have the class disrupted. I am not about letting my daughter be rude and I am more than proud knowing that she is a very polite and respectful little girl  but these are FOUR year old kids Coach Shauna is dealing with and if she doesnt have the patients to teach four year olds then she shouldn't be! i'm also pretty sure they are suppose to be having fun and they are not training for the olympics.

I explained to the technician that the polish extended onto the skin over my cuticle but she did not understand my problem. In my experience  polish on the skin will begin to lift rather quickly. The technician offered to redo the work but there is no way to fix the problem when you can't understand it in the first place. I was even blamed and told that this occurred because of my dry hands. Other salons that have done a good job usually begin the polish ~0.5mm away from skin and its a nice continuous swoop all the way around. I will not be returning to this salon and am truly upset that I was charged at all. I could have done a better job at home.",

And while I wish I could fully support a Filipino restaurant in Arizona  I just can't with this one....and for a HUGE reason.\\n\\nWe went here thinking it was Mike's Deli.  But apparently  it is gone and this went in in its place.  A family-owned Filipino restaurant.  I was in heaven and we went in instead of leaving to find another deli.  \\n\\nI ordered their pork lumpia (12 pieces) and their traditional pancit Bihon (I think this was the 2nd word)...two things I grew up absolutely loving when I lived in Mira Mesa (San Diego) surrounded by a ton of my Filiipino friends.  My best friend's mom made the BEST pancit and lumpia and it has been years and years since I have had any. I used to eat it at least once a week. Mmmmmmmmm. \\n\\nThe lumpia was just okay.  The meat wasn't ground up with the veggies  but rather more of a stick of pork wrapped.  Meh.  Reminded me of eating fake crab at a sushi restaurant.  Their sweet chili sauce was perfect though!  \\n\\nOkay  so then  they brought out what I was really really waiting for...my pancit!  When she set it down in front of me  I could already tell I was too excited for absolutely no reason.  There was no color to the noodles.  They looked like they had been taken straight out of the boiling water and placed on my plate.  Rice noodles are supposed to be practically see-through  but these were just as white as they were when they were taken out of the package. There were 2 slices of lemon  chopped carrots  some cabbage...and are you ready for this?  The pieces of chicken looked like they had only been boiled as well as the pieces of shrimp (I've never had traditional pancit with shrimp...so it's a good thing I am not allergic).  No type of seasoning/sauce or anything!  Soooo not traditional to me!  I know there are different regions or versions  but this is certainly not what I am accustomed to eating at my filipino Ate's or Tiya's houses.  I unwillingly squeezed my lemon over it and took a bite.\\n\\nOMG!  It took everything I had not to spit it out and get up to leave.  It lacked so much flavor it's not even funny.  Well  there was no flavor.  I felt like I was eating lemon flavored noodles.  The chicken was an afterthought and I couldn't even taste it.  \\n\\nHow could they?!  I am so upset and annoyed by this.  I am so glad I have had true traditional pansit because if this had been my first taste I would have sworn off the deliciousness of Filipino food for life.  \\n\\nMy friend had their chicken adobo and she thought it was just okay.  The chicken was very dry.\\n\\nI'm sorry to the family who owns this place  but you can't continue serving your customers with such lackluster flavorless food.  No one will want to come here.",

One thing to note if you are eating here before 10:30 in the morning is that if you are looking for a wide variety of breakfast items you will not find it here. You've got your choice of a bacon or chorizo burrito  bacon or chorizo taco which is just a smaller version of the burrito or lastly you can get a bacon or chorizo bowl. \\n\\nWhen I saw that there was a Groupon for this place I jumped on it  since I was still intrigued with my wife's bacon burrito  to give this place a second shot since it is a little on $$ side. \\n\\nWhat I love most about this place is the spicy mayo. They put that stuff on almost everything and it is absolutely to die for  minus the chorizo. I generally stop here any chance I can on my way to work and pick up a bacon burrito with extra spicy mayo.

I live by the shooting park so I'll probably become a regular for my Saturday brunch cravings.\"",

I found out the first time that they only serve them on weekends and was warned to come early.  The first time I came  I had my eye on the custard raisin roll.  There was only one left and the lady in front of me ordered it.  Apparently  what you see is all they have.  \\n\\nSo I came back again today (Saturday) at 9 am hoping for a wider selection.  I ordered everything I wanted: kronut  custard raisin roll  and a guava croissant.  Note! There were 3 raisin rolls when I placed my order.  Anyway  I ordered a sit-down meal and they brought me my kronuts to the table (I wanted all the pastries to go).  Then they brought out the meal I ordered.  I advised the waitress that I didn't receive my raisin roll or croissant.  She took my receipt and came back letting me know they sold all the raisin rolls.  WTF! Now I'm pissed.  She tells me she'll go see what they can do and assured me she'd make it right.  Another girl came back to me and apologized letting me know they sold them all and offered to replace it with another pastry.  I ORDERED EVERYTHING I WANTED! Anyway... I requested a refund and left.  \\n\\nMake sure they package your pastry when you place your order! I am upset but the staff was pleasant for both visits. They just need to work on their operation side of things.",

The special was their typical buffet and meats with a dessert option or 35$. It was actually a pretty good deal and ened up saving us $30 total. Upon walking in  I was blown away by he size of this place. Gigantic. It was also very busy as there was a late aftenoon private game that had just ended. I'm glad we made reservations seeing there was an hour and a half wait! \\nWe were quickly seated and the server helped us pick out a glass of wine. We were given a small bread basket with round  cheesy bread balls and were instructed to help ourselves to the appetizer buffet. The buffet has a selection of prepared salads  some seafood  meats and cheeses as well as greens/veggies to make a salad. After a quick salad  I was ready for the good stuff-the meats! Our server brought over our wine as well as fresh plates  a side of fried bananas to cleanse the palate and mashed potatoes. We turned our coaster to green and anxiously waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. We saw several skewers of meat come out of the kitchen but then they retuned to the kitchen area empty without coming anywhere near our table. I'm not sure if they didn't realize that we were waiting or if it was tso busy that they didn't make it to our table before running out but we missed many tasty looking meats. Our server stopped by to ask how it was going noticing our plates were empty. I explained the situation and within two minutes  the meat was exiting the kitchen in the opposite direction and headed toward our table. We tried the filet  ribs  lamb chops  leg of lamb  skirt steak  sirloin steak  rotisserie chicken  chicken wraped in bacon  parmesan crusted pork loin (my favorite) and plenty more. We lost track after 12 different meats. After having our fill  we both chose the banana foster pie for dessert. It too was so tasty and delicious. We left our meal feeling very pleased with the overall experience. My only criticism is that our other favorite churrascaria  (Green Forest) has a better appetizer buffet with a bigger selection of seafood items.",

It was very bizarre. \\n\\nWe ordered three rolls  an order of nigiri  and green mussels.

        "text": "We are Phil's Filling Station regulars  but thought we would give Kimmie's a try just to see what it was like. The location has had five restaurants over 15 years prior to Kimmie's and in our opinion  only one was good and they lasted the longest.\\n\\nWe arrived at 8:00PM (still unpacking from our vacation)  and were the last patrons to arrive. A great folk singer was playing at a perfect volume  and we enjoyed his pick of tunes; e.g.  John Prine  etc. A server promptly greeted us  provided menus and took our drink orders. The wine choices were extremely short  but when asked  the server told us of additional good wines that were recently added and hadn't shown up on a printed list yet (is in the process of being printed now). The beer list was almost all American  tap beers were only American with Fat Tire being the only non-global brewer. In bottles  only Heineken  Corona and Dos Equis are offered outside of the normal American fare. The restaurant completely misjudged the FH market in both wine and beer - the server admitted as much regarding the wine choices.\\n\\nWe ordered Blue Crab Cakes and Potato soup for starters. We both understand that you're never going to get great seafood in the middle of the Sonoran Desert  but we're fans of Blue Crab from S. Carolina (yeah  cakes are from Maryland  we know!) so my wife gave it a try. She said they were good and temp was perfect. My soup was tasty but on the cold side of warm.\\n\\nFor the main course  my wife had a rib eye steak with baked potato and I had a Cuban sandwich with cucumber salad as a side. My wife raised beef  so we're very picky about it. However she claimed the steak was excellent and temp was fine. My Cuban sandwich was very tasty and hot. The cucumber salad was different from what I am used too  having parmigiana cheese and Italian dressing in addition to the onions and cucumbers. I mentioned this when ordering and the server offered to replace it if I didn't like it. Surprisingly  it was darned good!\\n\\nOne thing they can do for better presentation is to get rid of the plastic disposable cups for dressing and sour cream and replace them with faux ceramic cups. The current cups look downright cheap. Also  butter comes in the plastic portion controlled containers  there are alternatives that present better and they should be considered. I understand that nearly 100% of all restaurants below five star use these  but if they upgrade their other containers  why not these - at least for dinner. I don't mind them for breakfast.\\n\\nOverall the service was just off on timing. Not terrible at all  just not as attentive as most people would expect. Given that we were the only patrons  it would worry me to try Kimmies if they were busy. Maybe we're spoiled by the service at Phil's where we know every single employee  including the kitchen staff and the busboys  but I strain to think that this level of service will be acceptable to the average FH citizen.\\n\\nAs for a claim about being a sports oriented place - not the case at all. There are smaller TVs around each wall  but not placed where you can see them if you're not seated at the bar. When we left  I looked at those above the bar as if I were sitting there  and they were too small to really see anything. There is American Grill next door with **many** larger TVs  and Phil's across the street with nine TVs conveniently placed in the bar for sports and a couple in the restaurant with news. My recommendation to Kimmies is to get rid of all of the TVs in the restaurant  and replace those over the bar with larger TVs. I recognize the cost of this  but sorry  you should have thought this through before opening.\\n\\nWith just a few tweaks  the place could easily be four stars. But my sense is that the owner isn't engaged enough to carry it out. They've been open six weeks which is plenty time to get past the starting hiccups. FH is a tough restaurant market  and Kimmies has maybe four weeks left to turn it around or they will be the sixth former restaurant in their location.",

My pork was just ok  I have had much better. The cole slaw that came with it was excellent.  His sandwich was good.  He wanted some mustard and had to go to the bar to get it as the waitress had disappeared.  The biggest issue I had was the side of potato salad I ordered.  Although they said it was homemade  it tasted like what you buy at the grocery store.  Not good at all.  I took one bite of it and told the waitress that  I didnt' like it and that it did not taste homemade.  She assured me that it was  and that she would let the chef know.  However  even though I only had a bite  the 4.00 charge was still on our check.  Very poor.  In addition  my husband had a scotch on the rocks with a splash of water.  $10 for the scotch and $2 for the rocks?    Who charges $2 for ice?

Off to a good start...\\n\\nWe were seen immediately by the waitress (Taylor I think) and another girl she was training. Both were nice  friendly  and full of smiles. Taylor tells us their \\\"\"\"\"special\\\"\"\"\" today is a $4 Kona Longboard draft. Thinking I missheard I asked her to repeat that. Nope  their beer special is a $4 draft. That's not a \\\"\"\"\"special\\\"\"\"\" folks  that's just a normal priced beer. On the plus side  however  they had a pretty good beer selection  though with no prices on the menu I think they failed themselves there. It's not a nice enough place for a no-price drink menu.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa cost $3.75 (which is $3.75 more than every other taco place I've been to in my life)  but we ordered them anyway because they came with \\\"\"\"\"bottomless chips\\\"\"\"\" and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5. The chips were light and actually pretty tasty  with no complaints about either of the salsas. That is until we ordered a refill of our \\\"\"\"\"bottomless\\\"\"\"\" chips  and were told the chips were bottomless but not the salsa. Ummm  ok maybe you should have said that upfront. 75cents for each extra salsa. We felt tricked  which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth  even before the mediocre entrees did the same.\\n\\nBefore we even ordered our entrees  we felt they were $3-$5 overpriced. For example  $12 for 2 corn tacos  $15 for 3 (though it does come with a side). For carb-watchers  they offer lettuce-wrap as a taco option  which we felt was a smart move  along with traditional corn or flour. I got the corn  my wife got the lettuce wrap. Unfortunately  both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks. Shout out to the service  they fulfilled our high-maintenance order of 2 different 2-taco entree choices  each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them. It's too bad neither taco was very good (we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor). For sides  my wife got the mexican street corn  which was by far the best thing we ordered. GET THIS SIDE. It's delicious. I could have skipped the entrees and the salsa and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy. I got the jicama radish slaw  which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots. I saw neither jicama nor radish. DO NOT GET THIS SIDE.\\n\\nHere's what we would tell the management if they had a \\\"\"\"\"contact us\\\"\"\"\" option on their website:\\n1) Reduce entree prices by at least $3\\n2) Always offer a reasonable drink special  even on Friday nights.\\n3) If you offer bottomless chips (and charge for them)  also offer bottomless salsa. Otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.\\n\\nBottom line: we probably won't go back anytime soon  but if they're still around in 6 months we'll check the menu to see if they've changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time. We live nearby and would love to see them be successful  they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews  taking advice  and adapting accordingly.\"",

They were very friendly and the food was tasty!\\nIt's kind of like Subway-esque where they make the items for you  not like Sweet Tomatoes where you make your own. I had a large salad (cobb with ranch) and my hubby got the pulled pork and cauliflower cheese soup. We also splurged on a chocolate cake slice and rocky road brownie  cuz you know that is needed after a semi healthy salad :p\\nOn my cobb  I wanted to sub cucumbers for olives and asked for extra ranch. It felt like pulling teeth to get a substitution and extra dressing. Hubby asked for no cabbage on his sandwich  but got it anyway. His pulled pork sandwich was mostly cabbage. The little meat that was on the sandwich and they bread were really good though. My salad was crisp and fresh. The soup was decadent and creamy. We mostly just dunked the bread into the soup like it was fondue. So good. The meals came with a chocolate strawberry and bread which was tasty.  The brownie was super rich and my hubby who is a sweets-aholic could only eat a few bites. Same with the cake. I recommend splitting a dessert or just be happy with the strawberries lol.\\nWhen ringing up they rang us for a salad and a separate soup. We almost didn't get our sandwich. They had already slid my card when I asked where our sandwich was and then they had to charge my card again for the difference. \\nAll in all there is high hopes for this place after they get their grove on. I do wish they had a build your own salad instead of just subbing things on their current menu without having to do extra $.50 charges for adding simple things like tomato or cucumber.",

They're big on smoothies too  although I've never sampled one yet since they don't tend to make it to the fridge.

I was really looking forward to spending NYE in Edinburgh and thought this hotel would round out a fun holiday.  How wrong I was.  \\n\\nAt first glance  the place looks impressive with quirky  fun decor. But it's all about the details  isn't it?  While the room was well furnished and large  the phone didn't work at all through the entire stay (and nobody came to fix it after maintenance made an appearance on day 1). So every time we needed anything  we had to go down to the front desk (see detail on staff attitude later in this review).  In addition  the beds were like wooden planks. \\n\\nAnd the breakfast was AWFUL.  Food two of the days was only partially cooked and inedible.  I'd upgraded our initial rate to include a full breakfast as part of a NYE package -- the upgrade cost about $100 US for two guests for three days.  But when we got to the cafe we were told our package only included the continental choice and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title)  after a discussion  told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\\n\\nWhich brings us to the hotel staff.  Most importantly to me  about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude  but this was shockingly insulting.\\n\\nLastly  I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it  only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\\n\\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.  Much more spendy  but worth every single penny.  \\n\\nI will NEVER again stay at a MerdeMaison property.  But as I don't think the Malmaison brand can possibly last with this type of service  hopefully nobody will have to.",

Big  lovely signage let me know I was in the right place.  The parking lot at the Arbo sucks - the lines aren't clearly marked anymore  pot holes  speed bumps  oddly configured  etc.  but there is plenty of parking.\\n\\nI was instantly greeted upon walking in by who I am guessing is an owner.  He told me to pick a table and left me with a menu as my waitress was already walking up to take my drink order.  Shortly after I placed my order.\\n\\nThe food:\\nFalafel ($5) - I have never had falafel before  but from what I have read  this was exactly it.  6 balls  about the size of golf balls  of deep fried chick pea mash with spices and I believe I saw onions.  It was quite spicy  but the thick tzatziki that they served with it was cooling and amazing.  I wouldn't order it that way again  but it was tasty enough.  \\nPhilosophy pita ($6) - Lettuce  Philly steak grilled with green peppers  mushrooms  onions  provolone and mayo.  I guess Showmar's has led me astray as to what a pita is  because this order was more like a wrap (thinner than a pita  thicker and sturdier than a tortilla).  It was served more like a wrap  but I did very much enjoy it.  There was a lot of lettuce (not a complaint) and the warm flavors in the wrap were good.  I ordered the potato salad with this and it was a yellow potato salad  so I was expecting a mustard taste  but it was sweet and very mild.  About the consistency of grocery store potato salad  but good.  \\n\\nMy waitress was super friendly and pretty efficient considering she was the only waitress waiting on everyone (most tables were families with kids).\\n\\nOn to the highlight of the evening - the gelato... holy smokes.  Creamy  yummy goodness.  The owner (extremely helpful  very personable) was manning the gelato bar when I was trying to decide and he volunteered NUMEROUS sample spoons of different flavors - hazelnut  salted caramel  pistachio  birthday cake  chocolate  I think one was called Turkish Delight  coconut  vanilla  I think there was a mocha or cappuccino - SO many flavors  it was incredible really - and each taste was just as delicious or more delicious than the one before.  I finally decided on a small cup ($3.84) of the biscotti flavor and it was heavenly.  A small cup was plenty too - it was so rich.  I was excited to see they had a Sugar Free Chocolate  so I will be hauling the parents over to try that after some lunch.\\n\\nThe meal was good  everything on the menu seemed to be very fair/reasonably priced as far as the food goes and I will definitely be back for more.",

But when I searched Yelp for mexican recommendations and saw this came up as highest rated I almost fell out of my chair. So of course I have to put in my two cents. Luckily  I have an excellent memory when it comes to things I care about i.e. food. \\n\\nFirst off  we went there right after they have opened so I will say maybe they were still working out the kinks  at least I hope they were.  On the positive side the dining room was clean  and it had some ambience (more than the typical taco shop would). Also  the owner attempted to rectify the situation  explained below  unfortunately it could not be. \\n\\nSo I got the carne asada fries. Typical gringo mexican dish - maybe that was my mistake and I should have ordered something more authentic. The fries were not cooked at the right temperature  they came out greasy and undercooked. Not to mention for the price  I believe around the $7 range  the portion was rather skimpy. Took it to the counter and explained the issue  the person who I believe was either the owner or manager  cooked the fries again. Same exact issue. Which tells me that it was not a mistake but that they were unaware what temperature oil should be to properly cook fries in. Ultimately  they refunded our money and we went elsewhere. \\n\\nThe service is the only reason that I am giving it two stars - to be honest I can't remember what my husband got  my guess is carne asada tacos and I tried some as I was starving due to having to wait for the re-fire of the carne asada french fries  but the tacos were not memorable.  I truly hope for their sake they improved  and from the sound of the other reviews  maybe they did. I suppose to give it a true review I should go back and try the food again but with the amount of taco shops in Vegas there are so many other place to try!",

When I got in the receptionist was very nice nice and professional and said it would be about 15 min. I sat and I waited and she came out told her name and walked me to the room for the wax. I have had a wax about 2 times before with Nola Spa which was amazing but I thought since they had a good deal on amazon local I would give someone else a try. The wax room was similar to a gyno office room. All white  some what small and extremely bright. Almost like there would be a spot light on you if you laid there. I found that to be discomforting  but I asssumed since I was a new client there would be some type of conversation or repor built between the waxer (Olivia) and myself. She stated \\\"\"\"\"please disrobe and lay down  I said is there a towel and she said no. Now being that I am used to going to Nola  where it a spa like atmosphere  zen music playing  and the waxer made me feel very comfortable. This was not the same at Nue. Over all I normally do not write reviews but for such a intimate appointment for a service  i would not want any one else to experience this. I have a hight tolererance and do not embaress easy so for me to say this is saying a lot. If its your first time or if you want to feel comfortable you may want to reconsider this spot for a brazillian or bikini wax. I would def recommend Nola Spa  google it.\"",

Too bad about the loooong wait for food.\\n\\nWe heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on New Years Day after going to the dog park downtown. \\n\\nWe placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes. Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one  or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary  and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system. \\n\\nThe self seating system can be a little chaotic  and you may have to wait around for people to leave. Many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours. The patio is dog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs  but be warned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.\\n\\nWe polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant. It was perfect. My bloody mary was awesome too  brimming with garden goodness. My only complaint is they are damn expensive. $9. Kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.\\n\\nThe 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait. The staff apologized profusely for the delay. I guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly. Luckily we had the day off and no where else to go  so we didn't mind too much.\\n\\nMy hubby and I both had the egg sandwich  but mine without bacon. It was scrumptious. Every ingredient was top notch. My only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole. The problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion. I DESPISE raw onion. If I would have know I would have skipped the guac. May sound finicky but I scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before I ate it. \\n\\nWe also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside  tender on the inside. Yum.\\n\\nThe staff is helpful  warm  and a lot of fun. Even with the raw onion issue  the expensive bloody mary  and the long wait for food  the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to sample the rest of the menu.",

I will go back to this restaurant for both any time I can.\\n\\nDelivery service:\\nI get the impression this is not their primary function. The driver I suspect is the owner  and he's nice enough. To be honest I try to make sure it's worth their time  and my delivery orders are almost always over $60. I use the eat24hours.com service to order. It's not the fastest service  the quoted time is 45-60 minutes  and I've have it delivered at 75 minutes once. When they are not busy I've received the order once at around 30 minutes. Overall I'm fine with this  as I said it's not their primary function. Infact some might consider delivery sushi a sin.\\n\\nOrder process is a little limited. This isn't the fault of Arata  since we go through a 3rd party. They do follow notes and comments on rolls and upgrades.\\n\\nPresentation is always good. I order deep fried rolls they come hot and the taste is always great. Now with that in mind my hot rolls come packaged with cold rolls or sashimi. I can deal with luke warm fish. So normally it's not even a concern. I had have luke warm sashimi and I've re-chilled it for comfort before. They usually include extra sauces at my request on the notes. I dont have to pay extra for basic requests. Also they write the names of each roll on the packaging which is helpful for beginners.\\n\\nAs for the quality this has also been great. Taste is amazing and the sauces are adequate  and not watered down. I've never felt shorted by different items. I have not really enjoyed crab  then again I avoid it where possible from ALL sushi restaurants so I can't fault Arata.\\n\\n\\nAYCE service:\\nOnly done this once. It was pleasant and I had no issues. I sat at the bar and the service was quick and they provided everything I wanted. Taste as always is amazing. The chef I had was new he was a little unsure of himself  but the experience was fine  and he tried hard on the rolls. Which I deeply enjoyed the experience. There are other AYCE dinning options around and I try to branch out when possible.  Though there was nothing wrong with this location.\\n\\n\\nI will do both services again.

I ordered chicken tortilla soup and my fianc\\u00e9 ordered the pork carnitas burrito. The burrito came out so fast it seemed like a frozen microwave burrito and my pathetic excuse for chicken tortilla soup was hot and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. My soup had cabbage  carrots  whole bay leaves  one piece of chicken and some tortilla strips thrown on top. Worst chicken tortilla soup I've ever had and what a let down. No black beans  corn  avocado  cilantro OR cheese ??? I don't know if we'll ever go back but hopefully they're popular fish tacos taste delicious because our menu items were terrible. The kitchen should serve quality food at all hours and just because I come at night shouldn't mean I should expect poor quality  especially in this city.",

Idk). \\\"\"\"\"Not to worry\\\"\"\"\"  we were told  \\\"\"\"\"we can replace your flooring no problem\\\"\"\"\"  we were told. \\n\\\"\"\"\"We can glue the paneling back down  no problem\\\"\"\"\"  we were told. \\nSo we bought the camper and also bought the Camping World's warranty. \\nWhile signing our paperwork  they \\\"\"\"\"fixed\\\"\"\"\" the panels with staples... I showed them that there were not any staples on any other panels and now the staples were coming through the opposite side panels inside the cabinets and they even missed a corner of the panel that was still not attached... I should have ran then  but they assured me it was not right and they will fix it.\\nSo we took the camper home for 2 weeks to play with it:)\\nWe then dropped it off and they kept it for 2-3 weeks   when we come to pick it up our brand new \\\"\"\"\"fixed\\\"\"\"\" camper.... While doing a walk through on site  my husband and I open the slide-out to see all the pretty new flooring  when something under the slide out catches on the new flooring and rips another hole it. \\nAlso  that paneling that was supposed to be fixed and \\\"\"\"\"glued\\\"\"\"\" back to TV center  was stapled all around the square! Those sharp staple ends were still sticking out of the paneling on the opposite side of the TV center  with chipped pieces of wood all laying inside the cabinet. As if nobody saw that... Or maybe didn't think we would care. (FYI - staples are not used to secure any other original paneling on the TV center)\\n**New list of \\\"\"\"\"fixes\\\"\"\"\": new flooring AGAIN  new flooring that was not extended into the bottom of the TV center (as it was to begin with)  shave off screw heads under kitchen table (that was the cause of the slide out catching on the flooring)  and try to fix the panels AGAIN (order new wall panels for the original side and the side THEY ruined with staples).\\nAnother 2-3 weeks later  we go to pick up the fixed camper (as they told us it was all done over the phone)... The new flooring has bubbles everywhere! Seriously?! Who is your quality manager that reviews all the work that is done?.. Not just a couple bubbles  not all small. Some bubble were more than 6-8 inches long. The paneling that was replaced had been cut too short on 1 corner and didn't fit snugly.. The paneling on the opposite side (that they ruined) was shoved in too snugly and caused the top of the wood paneling to be chipped and cracked. \\nSo disappointed in the quality of everything here. I mean I'm really not a complainer and my husband and I are very understanding people. I'm NOT trying to be picky  really if it was maybe one small bubble in the flooring or one side of the paneling was perfect and the other was less than perfect  I might not be writing this review. But IT IS OBVIOUS no one cares about their workmanship here. \\nWe then requested to speak to a manager who agreed that the flooring and paneling was not done correctly and assured us he would \\\"\"\"\"email\\\"\"\"\" several people (managers of quality dept.  parts.  etc) and get back to us for more repairs - I assume. \\nSo we had to leave the camper AGAIN....\\nWe are making payments on a camper that we can not use. I don't know what to do.\\nIt's just POOR quality of work that has completely taken the excitement out of having a camper.\\nThis story is to be continued...\"",

The party was @ 12pm and we all waited at the front of the park as they told us for a party attendant to arrive  it wasn't until 12:30 someone showed up and walked us to put table  our pizza was suppose to arrive at 1pm as did not come until 2pm  the crew was very inattentive. \\n     Itself order a chicken Caesar salad  please save your money and do not order or eat this  the piece of chicken did not look like real chicken and I really don't think it was and the salad was old and soggy.\\n      I must say the park itself with water slides  ect was a good time and my son and I greatly enjoyed it  but the staff and food could definitely have some improving  especially if your attending a birthday party that parent spent a lot of $$ for her child's special day and you guys did not make it special once so ever it's a real disappointment. And the good was an extreme disappointment considering the healthy option you did have tasted like yesterday's trash!",

This was not at all our experience.\\nHere are the facts:\\n-The metal handrails  all over the park  heat up so fast in the Vegas sun it will burn your hand; watch out for this if you have smaller children\\n-The staff is a group of unorganized teenagers with no clue or concern about customer service. They aren't trained well and it was difficult to even find someone who was actually 'in charge' to help with problems\\n-The lines are RIDICULOUS!!!! If you don't pay for the speed pass to hold your place in line for a ride  you have to stand-uncovered in the Vegas sun-to wait for a raft  then climb up the tower to again wait in line to actually go down the slide. Be prepared bc this adds another $35+ to your general admission ticket\\n-The rental rafts are a waste of money. They can only be used on 2 'rides' & none of the slides. Plus people just abandon them throughout the day so just pick up one of those when you want to float on one. \\n-The food is overpriced and gross  the sunscreen is outrageous  but I realize those prices are par for the course at any amusement park. \\n-Parking is a nightmare. Be prepared to walk...far\\n\\nMaybe in a couple more years they will have some of the kinks worked out but it's nothing but an expensive hassle.  Save your time & sanity as a local & just take your kids to the Rio pool for free.",

Bought the season passes since it's not that much more than one time admissions and we can come as often as we like. My daughter would  come everyday if it was up to her lol.  The park is not too big and we like it that way because wherever you sit  you are not too far from anything. The only thing that we had a problem with was with the teenagers working in the food outlet  they were just not working fast and did not really know what to do (need more training).\\nMust wear water shoes and lots of suntan lotion (or you will definitely get sunburned). The park was really fun  will be going back at least once a week.\\nGo early to get good seating with shades. Have Fun!",

        "text": "WNW is a pretty fun place. My family and I have season passes now and we had them last year. Some improvements I have seen from last year to this year are:\\n1. The lines are quicker  smoother  and shorter. We went on a Friday from 2 to 7 p.m. and I was surprised at how little we had to wait in each line. While last year the lifeguards would stand and watch you struggle your tube out of the rides and to the next person yourself  this year they quickly take your tube from you and give it to the next person so you don't have to...awesome! Love this.\\n\\n2. Faster pacing overall by the lifeguards in moving the lines along. For example  on the ride with the blue mat next to Canyon Cliffs  they now have numbers that the next riders up stand on behind each slide  eliminating a step for when it's your turn. \\n\\n3. The new Tornado is awesome!!!!\\n\\n4. I love that they have so many refillable food/drink items. Not only can you buy refillable drink bottles still  but you can now buy refillable ice cream dishes and icee cups for pretty reasonable prices.\\n\\nComplaints I Have:\\n\\n1. Lifeguards should wear watches or there should ve a clock we can see somewhere in the park. Wierd how lifeguards on duty don't even know what time it is when you ask them.\\n\\n2. The gift shop floor gets wet obviously so it becomes slippery and I even almost slipped and fell on it before. Although I did bring this up to a rude clerk as well as a manager last season  nothing has been done about it even to this day. A non-slip mat you'd think would be an easy solution.\\n\\n3. Slow food lines.\\n\\n4. Cold  gross food. The pizza is pretty okay though and the fries are okay if they're fresh.\\n\\n5. The water seems extra dirty...seems like they could have better filters.\\n\\n6. Last years gold and regular season passes both allowed you 6 free friend passes to bring a friend anytime you wanted. This year the gold pass only lets you bring a friend for free once a month and the regular pass allows you to bring a friend once a month for a fee of $15.....bummer. I loved last years friend benefits way more. Nonetheless  the seasin passes are pretty affordable since you gets your moneys worth with just two visits. I just wish our friends could come with us more.\\n\\n7. The customer service was horrible last year and it has only improved slightly. Many of the lifeguards seem to have careless teenager attitudes most of the time even when you just ask them a simple question.\\n\\n8. This new WNW just doesn't serm as big and excellent as the one we had here in Las Vegas when I was a kid...could be because everything seems bigger and better when you're a kid...not sure. \\n\\nEven though I do have a few complaints and WNW still has some room for improvement  I am still happy to have it back to give kids something to do in this very hot city. They really should have never taken it away.",

I looked at a few of the behind the scene videos just to get a background of the show and Dancers.  It helped.  Check out the videos on Cirque's Youtube page.\\n\\nIf you love seeing people dance  this is the show for you.  Im not into the dance shows on tv  but damn  I can sure appreciate some talent when I see it.  I think damn near everyone on the stage could moonwalk.  There are a lot of acrobatic parts to the show as well.  \\n\\nMy favorite part of the show was not the MJ Hologram (which was badass  I must say).  I'll just say  wait for the part with the\\\"\"\"\" Lights that outline the dancers Suits\\\"\"\"\"  That part alone was worth the price of admission.  I don't know how anyone can coordinate something like that.  EPIC..... \\n\\nFor some reason  I expected to see a MJ lookalike throughout the whole show  which initially  I was slightly disappointed.   That made the MJ Hologram that much more awesome.  I get the chills just watching that part of it.   At that moment  I envisioned what it would of been like to see him LIVE.  \\n\\nJade Xu has some serious skills with that BO.  The twins from Chile got some serious dance skills.  There was one black guy who was dressed different from everyone else.  I've never seen anyone dance like him.  It looked like he was just hovering from one end of the stage to the other.  Just gliding on his tippy toes.  Salute to you amigo.  \\n\\nAs for the seating area.  I sat in row 19 of section 102.  It was the last row.  Great seats right in the middle.  I'd suggest getting seats towards the back of 102 or the First row of sections 202  203 or 204.  The show is all around you.  The dancers at times pass behind me and dance along the walkways.  I had people dangling right above my head.  Their is action going on to the far right and far left of the stage.  Even at the beginning of the show  the 4 teenagers that star in the show are mingling with people in the seats.   So  if you are thinking of getting seats  go back a little further.  \\n\\nWould I go again..  HELL YEAH. At times it felt like a party.\"",

The menu has the healthy side and the not so healthy side. It is soooo very hard to pick. I wanted to order ALL the things! (they also have a secret menu if you ask) I was torn between the Shroom'in in Philly and the Chix on Broadway. The staff said I wouldn't be disappointed with the Chix on Broadway and I wasn't! It had a huge chicken breast that was very juicy! The bun was lite and didn't fall apart when I cut it in half. It also had lots of cheddar cheese on it. I choose a house salad to go along side and that too was huge and yummy! Dyanna ordered off the secret menu and got chicken and waffles. Which was huge as well and piled with chicken on top of a crisp waffle. \\n\\n\\nSkinnyFats also has cucumber water that you can refill yourself. Total score!

It was a free class complete with mini Jamba smoothies courtesy of Jackie and Barre3  and I was intrigued.\\n\\nI started going to physical therapy for my lower back and right hip - as soon as my birthday hit I started to fall apart and now Eric R. wants to exchange me for another wife (just kidding).  However  being married to a very active person has been interesting because while I love to hike I never really enjoyed being in the gym or doing other activities of the sort.  My physical therapist liked that barre supplements my therapy so I knew it was a good idea to take the introductory 3 for $30 deal offered by the studio.\\n\\nLast Saturday I dragged Eric R. with me to the Oklahoma red cross donation class  so we both donated the full class cost each to help with the tornado destruction.  We went to the second class and ran into Molly T. leaving the first class.  Eric R. realized barre3 was quite tough and is a great workout for me.  We had Alison as an instructor and she was great.  I came yesterday to my first paid class with Jackie and it was hardcore!  Each of the three classes has had slight variations on movements and stretches  so I like the element of surprise and the activation of muscles that never ached before!\\n\\nI really liked the atmosphere here as it is clean and spacious.  I also like how the instructors will work with each individual's injuries and help adjust us during the class.  We are told to listen to our bodies and take breaks as needed.  There is no pressure but instead a lot of encouragement.  For those of you with children  childcare only costs $5 per class and is offered during morning classes and on Tuesdays and Thursdays for afternoon classes.  You can go barefoot or wear barre/yoga sticky socks.  This is the perfect place for me to wear my Nike studio wrap pack that I bought when it first debuted.\\n\\nEach class works legs  arms  glutes  and core and includes ample stretching throughout the class.

I decided to try their shrimp paste  pork chop  Vietnamese meat loaf over rice plate and a drink consisting of condensed milk  raw egg  and club soda.  \\nI was a bit queasy to try the drink but wanted something different~ as it turned out  the drink is tasty~ a bit like liquid custard.  I think it would taste even better with a bit of salt sprinkled in to enhance the flavor.  I have to laugh though since none of the other wait staff  including the owner has tried this drink even though it's on the menu!\\nThe rice plate was good.  Everything tasty.  Only bit of turn off was the pork chop came out really greasy.  Had a layer of oil on both sides that I had to sop off with a couple of napkins.\\nThe wait staff were friendly  so friendly in fact that they waved and hollered out good bye to me without giving me the check.

The patio has nice lighting so you're not sitting in the dark or barely able to see what you're eating.  After we were seated it did take about 7 mins for our server to notice us and get our drinks and since we had the extra time we also knew what we wanted to eat.  After that initial wait the service was great though.\\n\\nOn to the food!  Ordered Clam strips for an app. Super yummy.  A tad bit chewy  but the hubs and I didn't mind.  Got the kids' popcorn chicken and fish and chips at that time.  Both got the seal of approval from 2 picky eaters.  One minor thing was that the fries were pretty under done almost inedible.  I don't give them fries that much so we just ate the ones that were done and they couldn't even finish those.  Good sized kids portions even without the fries.  \\nGrown up meals:  We wanted to try a few items.  Got orders of shrimp tacos  ahi tuna tacos and blackened grouper tacos.  All of them were cooked to perfection!  Nothing was even close to being overcooked  seriously perfect.  While all the tacos were great the blackened grouper was the stand out by far.  The beans were also amazing.  Something as simple as pinto beans and SoCal made them memorable.  The rice was just meh  unfortunately got some uncooked grains in with the cooked  mmmm crunchy goodness  not so much.  The mango salsa was flavorful with a nice kick to it.  I don't know what the 1 star guy was talking about with everything being canned and bland.  The cocktail sauce was a bit ketchupy but that's about it.  Also got a Long Island Iced Tea  good but for $6 it was small at around 10 oz.  \\n\\nOverall:  nice ambiance  small service and kitchen hiccups with it being new  the tacos are what matter and they are STELLAR!  Will definitely recommend to friends and family and be back frequently.",

We arrived on a Sunday morning  at 10 am  and were told that the wait time was 60 to 75 minutes.  TWO HOURS LATER  after checking with the hostess three times after 90 minutes  we were told that we were the next table and that there were only 3 names ahead of us.  I didn't have the heart to ask WHAT that meant!  Obviously  by the time that we were seated  we had decided which items each of us would order.  Between the 8 of us  we each ordered something different to try and get a good cross section of the offerings.  Ok  lets start with the positive.  Our server was excellent.  Ummmmmmmmm  I didn't try the bacon  but it looked fine.  Our booth was comfortable.  Silverware was clean.  Now  the rest of the story.  One would think that with a two hour wait the food should be pretty darn impressive.  Most of the people  who were around us while we were waiting  were also making their first visit to Snooze AM Eatery.  It will be interesting to see how long the hype can keep crowds curious.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It arrived with 2 cold eggs  over easy  and a pitiful small helping of burnt has browns with less than an ounce of corned beef.  (I've owned my own restaurant for 30 years  it was less then an ounce.)  I tried 2 bites of each of the pancakes that we had ordered.  The first to see how they were  and the second to make sure that they were actually as bad as I thought after the first bite.  I honestly don't know which was worse  the presentation  or the nasty taste.  They all sounded great on the menu.  Well  they can certainly talk the talk  but they definitely can not walk the walk.  Lets just say that I would not return to this restaurant if it was across the street from my house  with no wait  and it was free.  At 61 years of age  and for someone who has eaten all over the Country  and eats out often  this is by far the worst food that I have ever been served in a restaurant. P.S.

They call u by texting your cell. Problem was that after 40 minutes I went in to see what was going on and the host said he texted me 10 minutes ago. Well he wrote down the wrong cell # and said \\\"\"\"\"oops  will put u back on the list\\\"\"\"\". I told him \\\"\"\"\"so for your mistake u want me to wait again?\\\"\"\"\" He realized that wasn't right so he sat us.\\nAfter we sat  the waitress greeted us 5 minutes later and we ordered coffee. Which btw  the little cue card on the table says the owner searches all over Costa Rica for the right coffee beans. Hmmm  then he must have went to Folgers plant located there cause it ain't nothin special.\\nAgain  10 minutes pass and we get to order. I had a scramble and the wife had the corned beef hash.\\nTrying to flag down our waitress for a coffee refill was difficult as she was more concerned on how she looked in her LuLu lemon yoga pants rather than on the customers. \\nFood arrives. \\nMy scramble was slopped together overcooked dry and the potatoes are put in a mold to look fancy  not! \\nWife's corned beef....in edible  tasted like it was sitting out for hours & extremely sour.\\nWaitress never bothered to ask how the meal was or thank you  just put check on table.\\n$30 for 2 pathetic excuses for food and 1 \\\"\"\"\"mystery\\\"\"\"\" coffee.\\nWe got duped!!!!!  Be wise and take a stand  no more eating at places just cause it looks \\\"\"\"\"cool\\\"\"\"\". \\nYeah.. I guess u could say I was pissed writing this review.

        "text": "\"Pacino's fell short on all requirements of a good restaurant. So it is Valentines Day night. I called in ahead of time and asked about the wait time  a discombobulated hostess shouted about in my ear trying to find out who could clean tables and how long and finally tells me they have one table open. We were there in a matter of only 5 minutes and saw plenty of open tables but shrugged it off. We waited while the table cleared and were sat down. After waiting nearly 25 minutes I finally caught the attention of a hostess and asked when we could expect to see our server and if we could see a menu. It is only now that I am told no menus are available that I can only opt in for their $40 per person 4 course pre fixe meal and neither one of us are 4 course hungry. I just asked that she have the server come over to the table to talk with us. *now quick side note I am an extremely observant person so when we were waiting for a table to clear earlier at the hostess desk I noticed the woman who should have been our waitress crying and being consoled by a girl near the front desk. Now I also have an empathetic heart and had felt sympathy for the woman when I saw this but if she had something going on that was interrupting her ability to work she should have gone and spoken with her manager for a solution*  Our waiter finally did come over and asked if we had questions about the pre fixe  I mentioned that we had never been told it was the only option and asked if we could order al a carte from the options available for the night. I was very kind yet firm in my request and before I even finished I got an onslaught of excuses  \\\"\"\"\"the computers can't input that\\\"\"\"\" \\\"\"\"\"we don't have the capability\\\"\"\"\" he even went as far as to begin to explain their food coding system and then finally did the right thing and said \\\"\"\"\"let me check to see if that is possible\\\"\"\"\" his frustration showed through his voice and eyes but he came back and let me know they could and then inflated the al a carte prices pretty exorbitantly $25 for 5 shrimp raviolis $23 for their chicken with squash and scalloped potatoes on the side. His service got better as the night progressed and as he understood that my appreciation for him accommodating the request was not fake. My date said his food was good and mine was seeming the same until I bit into the middle of the ravioli and found that the center on each of them was still ice cold. I should have said something but I didn't  I was just tired from the day and the escapades already so I ate them avoiding the center on each. The food was good  minus the frozen centers  but I have to be honest in saying that Alessia's Ristorante Italiano down the way is of much better quality  taste and most importantly service. I also wanted to discuss the attitude of the owner  or at least I assume he was an owner or manager. He wore brightly colored red/orange pants with a striped orange shirt and graciously greeted every guest around us except our table. This was absolutely appalling! He even stopped by a table of what appeared to be regulars several times  laughing and personally removing their finished plates. I have a background with customer service and so I decided to give him a chance as not to misinterpret the body language of our table and looked him dead eye until he saw me and still I got nothing  not a polite head nod or a simple thank you. You really can not treat your guests like that  they have chosen to devote their time  money and valentines day to your restaurant and that is how you treat them? I think he is forgetting that his guests are who create their success  without us there won't be a need for what you have to offer. Any way  the only two good things I did experience were this  our waiters attitude finally turning around midway through our meal and I wish we would have been seated outside because I watched another waitress in a red dress hustling back and forth from the kitchen to the outside without skipping a beat giving her guests a great experience on their valentines day. I could tell because each person I could see through the open doors had a bliss filled smile on their face  the way everyone should have been made to feel that night.\"",

You could pick from one with tomatoes on it  or one with cheese on it  that was it.  I choked down what was a small piece of bread with a few tomatoes on it.  Next  we got a salad  which was basically some lettuce thrown onto a plate with no dressing on it.  You got a choice of 4 appetizers  chicken  pork  shrimp ravoli  or steak.  They informed us they were out of the steak and chicken.  My wife got the ravioli  which was 5 ravioli stuffed with cheese.  They took a small piece of shrimp and cut it into 3 pieces and threw it on the plate.  Her's was ice cold. \\nThey did prepare a chicken for me even though they were \\\"\"\"\"out of it.\\\"\"\"\"  It was essentially the same amount of chicken in 2 chicken wings.  It was cold and very  very dry.  \\nThey threw some vegatables on it that weren't cooked and had been sitting out all day  so were dried out and hard.  They topped it of with a giant scalloped potato cake that was probably from costco.  Was cold as well. \\nWe told the waiter that this food was unacceptable.  He did apologize and felt bad  so I don't blame him at all.  He said he would get us a piece of tiramasu  instead of the few desserts we were forced to get.  \\nThe owner came over and said that we were one of the later tables  so that is the reason our food was bad.

We sat down and again there were at least 2 servers and a busser still no hello or a menu. Made eye contact with the cooks-still nothing. So after about another 7 minutes we decided to leave. How hard is it to greet someone and you WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY? Just flat out rude. I went there b/c I was in the area and the yelp reviews. Never again!",

They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My \\\"\"\"\"large\\\"\"\"\" pho was ok  but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe  or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts  shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later  cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any  can't blame him)  I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the \\\"\"\"\"fresh\\\"\"\"\" taste  but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started  not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope  done.\\n\\nThis place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave).

I cannot guarantee on behalf of them that it will always happen but considering the fact that I've been there more than 10 times and (more to go) It has been always like that. \\n\\nServing: Sky is the limit for the service. Restaurant business is carried by people and as long the \\\"\"\"\"intentions\\\"\"\"\" of the owner or employees are striving for the best  I'm down for it. You can simply see that in owners or the waiters eyes that they just want to serve you in the best way possible. \\n\\nRemembrance of the food: I happen to see some bad comments about the quality of the food. I don't say they are manipulating the truth but I have no doubt that owners would compensate it if those individuals would request a better plate. It is a human driven place and people might make mistakes unintentionally. Based on my all visits  the food was just always a good remembrance of what I've enjoyed in my hometown and I will be their loyal customer as long as I have that feeling. \\n\\nPrice/standard ratio: Although this is very relevant and subjective issue  my opinion is the prices are fine. Yes  you can find some items a lot cheaper in somewhere else but that doesn't necessarily obliges the restaurant drops their prices. There are also other customers who keep buying from that \\\"\"\"\"Expensive\\\"\"\"\" price so bear with it. \\n\\nTidiness: I think the place is clean and seems improving. I had the conversation with the owner and if he can realize what he is thinking about decoration  it might be one of a kind restaurants in Chandler with a combination of satisfactory food  nice atmosphere and great hospitality. \\n\\nPeople who knows me already are also aware of that restaurant indirectly but for those who don't know me  I definitely recommend this restaurant.\"",

The mozzarella was amazing and the bread fresh and light.  I had the flat iron steak  which was prepared medium rare  with a spicy light tomato sauce for dipping.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the taste.   \\n\\nMy youngest daughter had the Mac and cheese  which she proclaimed better than Morton's (which is saying something).  \\n\\nMy oldest daughter had the hamburger  which was freshly made and quite delicious too  although she felt is was bit overdone ( I liked it).  \\n\\nMy wife had the salmon  which was a little dry  but sooo good.  \\n\\nThe wine selection is excellent and I suggest you have the waiter make some suggestions  cause they know their stuff.\\n\\nBut the best part about our experience was the atmosphere.  This is a family owned place and the owners make you feel like you're at their home.  Olga  a regular  was celebrating her 50th birthday.  We were offered cake and invited into their conversation  which made the whole experience better.  The owners showed us their wine bottling area and gave us a brief history of all the vino that flowed so freely.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this place enough and hope they continue to thrive.",

I had a terrible dinner.\\n\\n The appetizer called a Charcuterie plate was dry  bland toast triangles  squares  of cheese like we used to have in high school  some dried cranberries and almonds. \\n\\nTheir Twisted Burger  which was supposed to be their specialities  had so much overly sweet onion jam  barely cooked bacon  unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible.. The fries were cold. And the most surprising part was the wine pour  barely 3 oz. in a big wine glass. The owner was running the bar. and the waitress told us that's all  he allowed.  The wine was really good  and was from their own winery. You would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase. Talk about poor marketing!  After commenting to the waitress  the second glass had a little more. I asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasn't open and i would have to order a glass. Wouldn't it have made more sense to open the bottle  as I may have purchased it or at least had 1-2 glasses. Poor marketing again.\\n\\nThis was the second time I tried this restaurant  knowing it was bad the first. But wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.  I would have thought they would cater more to their patrons  as this time of the year  most of us in AZ are residents and it could become one of our favorites.  I hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better customer service  along with a customer-friendly owner could surely help.\\n\\n* By the way  the food pictures below were not even on the menu.",

Let's start with the good - friendly cashier  good tasting food. The bad? Everything else. The place was a complete disaster. It was dirty  the women's bathroom was broken and the men's restroom didn't have a working sink. Only the hot water knob was functional thus hot scolding water was the only option if you were brave enough to wash your hands (don't worry I did). I waited patiently for about 20 minutes and then grew rather impatient after 40. Finally when my order was delivered it was incomplete. I saw other customers having similar issues so I didn't panic. I asked for my order to be corrected and it wasn't. The cashier was a little too friendly and was too busy talking up customers to address my issue with urgency it required. I asked for a refund for the missing items from my order and unfortunately the cashier was unable to help me. She solicited the help of a cook who didn't speak really good English. She asked me how much I paid for my taco...I pointed to the menu and she attempted to swipe my card at least 4 times without success. Finally  I asked for my card back and just told her to forget it. All this time there is a manager type in the back room on his laptop being rather useless. I'm hopeful this person is a vendor and not an owner or manager. He never came to help quell the traffic or help out his overburdened staff. Overwhelming disappointed in that a few basic restaurant rules weren't followed - advise customers that the kitchen is backed up  offer a replacement for a missing item  how to manage a POS system  delivering \\\"\"\"\"fast food\\\"\"\"\" in under 40 minutes. I hope this place gets it together  too many good restaurants in Charlotte who can fill this void.\"",

They obviously support Yelp  which means Yelpers must support them.  \\n\\nWe walked in around 9pm  so it was only about half full.  We took a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The wine is all reasonably priced.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and added mushrooms (which might be a crime against humanity in Italy but that's how we like it).  We also spilt a salad to share.  The pizza was perfectly cooked.  Unlike some other Neapolitan pizza joints  this pizza had an even char across the entire pie.  It was an amazing pizza and you could tell that all the ingredients were the absolute best quality.  The bartender and our server for the evening  David  was making a delicious looking martini with hibiscus and peach schnapps so I went ahead and ordered one for myself as well.  I don't remember what it was called (the first glass of wine had already gone to my head) but it was one heck of a great martini.  For dessert  we ordered the cr\\u00e8me brulee which came with strawberries and raspberries on top.

I really wanted to like this place  but the Maitre D' really flushed the entire mediocre experience down the toilet last night....\\n\\nThe set up of the restaurant is not optimal as it is all high tables and high chairs. We were two couples seated at the corner of the table and so it was a little difficult to carry on a conversation at such a weird angle. But  no stars removed for poor design....\\n\\nThis is a meze (ie. tapas) bar  and so the menu is quite limited. I didn't find it to be super varied to be honest  but we chose 8 distinct tapas to try out and were excited about them. As soon as our waiter (who later bluntly informed me that he was the maitre d') took our order  he fussed about us having placed two separate orders as two couples. He told us that it was in our best interest to order things as a group of 4 rather than in couples to \\\"\"\"\"enhance the experience\\\"\"\"\". We then informed him that we had some food intolerances etc  and that we preferred to order separately. He was very displeased but we didn't really care because.. well... why tell us how to place our orders??? This was definitely not our first tapas experience and so we know that our night won't be \\\"\"\"\"ruined\\\"\"\"\" if we have two separate bills..\\n\\nOnto the food and service... Service was pretty slow (over 2 hours!) and they forgot to bring out one of our dishes. Food was mediocre at best. Not one single dish was amazing  and some dishes lacked any real flavor. Portion sizes were as expected. \\n\\nUp till this point  I was mentally rating this restaurant as a 3.5/5 (because that's what I do.. haha). But what happened next was really phenomenal.\\n\\nWe were asked if we were done  and after mentioning that they forgot a dish  I asked for it to be removed from the bill because we weren't going to wait another 30 min for another mediocre plate. My husband also distinctly asked for 2 bills. Lo and behold  we get one bill totalling $250. At this point  I'm aggravated because not only was the service so-so the entire night  but now our requests were being flat out ignored.\\n\\nSo  I call him back  and explain quietly that we asked for two bills. I get told that this restaurant doesn't make out separate bills because this is a \\\"\"\"\"group experience\\\"\"\"\". I then tell him that every single restaurant in Montreal will split bills  and that we had placed our orders separately in the first place to make things easier. He then told us that they don't split bills because he \\\"\"\"\"doesn't have time to split a tapas plate into 1/5 of the price for everyone who requests it  BUT that because he's the matire d'  he'll make a special exception  AND not to expect it next time because this is a GROUP EXPERIENCE\\\"\"\"\"'.............\\n\\nDo I really need to explain my frustration??\\n\\nSo I told him that we were not asking for ANY tapas to be split any way  and that we just wanted separate orders on separate bills. At this point  we could have paid it as is but it was really a matter of principle.....\\n\\nUGH. Seriosuly  hands down  worst service in Montreal. Not worth the trip OR our $150 bill. You can get much better tapas in tons of places in Montreal for that price.\\n\\nBLEH.\"",

I returned the item (and it showed as delivered via FedEx) and now it's been two weeks without receiving a credit. I have emailed them 3x without a response. I tried calling  and have been put on hold for 20 minutes. They say they will call you back  and they don't. I am going to give it another week  and then I am relegated to contact my credit card company to get the charged reversed. Frankly and sadly  this should not come down to this...\\n\\nAVOID FRANK &OAK!",

I aksed for the lox cream cheese.  Instead of putting the cream cheese on the toasted bagel they filled this 1/4 lb tub container (way too much for a single bagel) with the stuff and then charged me an additional $2.25 for the cream cheese.  Their explanation was lox cream cheese is a specialty item and they have to charge more...  however it seems odd to me that a) cream cheese is included in the price and they would not charge me extra for the regular cream cheese they smear on so why is it they have to charge for a 1/4 tub of specialty cream cheese and b) the difference between $2.25 and $1.50 ( for a 1/4 lb tub of regular cream cheese) is $0.75 cents so why are they just not charging me that difference.  Neither the clerk or the manager had good answers just that was what the charge was...\\n\\nDunno if I will be back as I do feel ripped off.  Its too bad becuase I really liked their bagels.\\n\\nSo be pre-warned!! If you order any specialty cream cheese they wont tell you upfront about the increased charge!!!",

I wasn't sure and said yes I think so because I've been to massage places before but wasn't sure if it was this particular place. She demanded I pay full price and can't use the voucher. After she tried looking for me in the system and couldn't find me I was able to use the groupon. The day of the massage came and my boyfriend woke up with a sharp painful back pain and couldn't get out of bed. I called to ask if I could reschedule and Sue angrily addressed me by my name and said that I can't because I wasted two 80 minute blocks in her schedule. She came off so rude and irritated when I was being polite the entire time even after she kept being so rude over the phone. Something came up and I asked to reschedule. Things happen. She refused to let me reschedule. Regardless of the cancellation policy there was no reason to treat a customer with such irritation and anger. I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

It's simple  it's pretty and everything sounds good. They have their set up assembly line style. Ordering is easy. If you have any troubles  the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two. I've tried the Crab Avocado Melt  the Turkey Bacon Avocado (I think you can tell that I like avocado) and the Asian BBQ Pork. The Crab and the Turkey were pretty good (they're paninis) but the Asian BBQ Pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat. It is good  but I'm better off buying a Bahn Mi. Bahn Mis are usually cheaper too. I haven't tried their salads. They didn't seem interesting enough for me. Their soups are never hot  they're always this awkward warm temperature. I'm not sure if they could microwave them  but if I'm paying $7.99 for soup and a sandwich  I'd expect the food to be adequate. I've tried the Lobster Bisque which isn't bad. I've also had their Swiss Onion Soup that's a temporary item. It was good. Another thing is that their soup station was messy. I saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves  so I'm pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down. \\n\\nWith the $7.99 combo  it comes with a slice of cold bread loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Sexy  huh?\\nYeah  I guess it could be sexy... Unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy. (Not judging if you are!)\\nThe first issue I had with the strawberries is that there were leaves MELTED IN WITH THE CHOCOLATE. Honestly  how could you miss that?  How can you expect your customers to NOT notice it? Luckily that time  I brought it up and they switched it out. Easy. Done. I didn't even have to ask them to switch it out.\\nTonight was another story. After my sister ate her strawberries  she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag. It was a tiny bug. Like the kinds you find with the berries you didn't wash yet. First  I brought the bag to the cashier. I asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever. She's like  \\\"\"\"\"Yeah  we wash them. Sorry about that.\\\"\"\"\" in the most \\\"\"\"\"omg  it's late and I just want to get out of here. It's not my fault you have issues.\\\"\"\"\" attitude ever.  Didn't offer if I want to talk to the manager or anything. That was a problem for me. I'm like  \\\"\"\"\"okay  thanks I guess.\\\"\"\"\"  I waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by. I told her what happened and she brought out Joe  the manager. Joe explained to me that it's corporate policy that the berries come pre-washed. He said the chocolate wouldn't stick to it otherwise. He then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning. He offered another dessert or another strawberry  which was nice. We didn't take it  we were a bit grossed out by the bug. \\n\\nYeah  I can say (with a lot of confidence) that we won't be returning there. Ever. Not even if you paid for my meal. If I wanted soup or anything like what they have  Panera Bread is down the street and Sweet Tomatoes isn't far from there either.  If you do go  just watch out for bugs!\"",

I bought a Groupon and when the service agents arrived I told them that I needed the ducts cleaned because I have a very sick son who suffers from allergy and asthma  among other issues.  I never should have done this because they played on my weakness (and stupidity!).  We are two smart business professionals and we fell for this  I can't imagine how many elderly or less capable people they've taken.\\n\\nEssentially I believe this company runs a scam cleaning/air duct servicing business by performing unnecessary/unneeded services at 5 times the original quoted rate. I hired this company to clean my air ducts for $49 per condenser. When they arrived they informed me that they needed to clean the units as well  to the tune of $255 a piece. I felt like I had no choice--in order to get the service I paid for I had to pay an additional $600+! To convince me that this service was needed they showed me pictures that were supposedly taken of my units just minutes prior. I agreed and they were in and out in less than an hour. I checked online after the service and see that this company is notorious for this scam. Every single review I could find mentions this claim that in order to clean the ducts the homeowner must pay to have the units clean. The scam is always the same--show the homeowner pictures of units with mold and proceed to tell them cleaning is required in order for duct servicing. \\n\\nIn addition to checking online I contacted my contractor who remodeled my entire home from top to bottom and completed the project the week before this company cleaned the ducts. He said that the pictures they showed me of my air duct units could not have been mine as mine were cleaned off well by his workers during the remodel FOR FREE and there were absolutely no signs of mold. Not only that  but he informed me that these units get dirty  it's just a fact.  They are meant to function that way.  It appears they use pictures and descriptions of other units to scare you into cleaning the units. Mold  mice droppings  dirt--you name it  they claim you have it.  Not only did they charge me $600 based on what appear to be false representations  but they also failed to perform the service they were originally paid to do--clean the ducts. My contractor checked the ducts in my master bathroom the day after Custom Air Specialists came out and he said they were never cleaned as claimed.  My contractor has become extremely familiar with my home over the past few months and has nothing to gain  so he has no reason to be anything less than straightforward. \\n\\nThis company should be put out of business  but apparently they go by several names so a closure likely wouldn't affect them. \\n\\nBuyer BEWARE!  Don't be as dumb as I am.  When this company tries to upsell you and claim your units are in horrible condition and won't function properly  call a more reputable business.",

We used to drive 40 minute to get there at least once a week. When we heard that Cave & Ives was reopening under a new concept and new name  we were hesitant to go back. We didn't want to ruin the fond memories we had of Cave & Ives. Now we kick ourselves and say  \\\"\"\"\"Why have we not been back sooner!\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAs soon as we walk through the door  we were greeted with familiar faces and some very pleasant surprises. Ryan  the bartender that we loved for his great service and beer knowledge  was still there. In fact  they added more taps and now serve even more varieties of beers than before. They no longer have the large selection of bottled beers  but their draft beer selection was  and is still  very impressive. If you don't know what to drink  ask Ryan. He will not steer you wrong. In fact  we often choose to sit at the bar because Ryan is there. \\n\\nWe were ecstatic to see that the menu hasn't changed too much either. The burger is still being served and all the pizzas are still the same. If you go to The Attic for the first time  YOU MUST ORDER THE BURGER!!! Ryan just informed us tonight that their burger was named one of the top 10 burgers in the United States! The Burger is a grill 1/2 lb. patty topped with grilled onions  chipotle mayo  spring greens  on a pretzel bun with your choice of cheese  and a side of French fries. If you can  order the bacon  saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms  and blue cheese.  You can also order The Hangover Burger  which is the burger with a fried egg and bacon strips. If you're into spice  ask the server for Da Bomb. They keep it behind the bar. Our second favorite item on the menu (by a very close second) is the steak salad. They didn't have it this time  but Ryan assures us that the steak salad will also be coming back soon.\\n\\nWe were so happy that the experience of going to The Attic has not diminished our memories of Cave & Ives. The new d\\u00e9cor with darker walls and pops colorful art is a plus. The music choices and more relaxed atmosphere made the place better. We also discovered that they added a burger challenge to the menu. Each challenger will need to each more than the last challenger (1 more patty  1 more egg  2 more strips of bacon). The winner gets to rename the burger and get their picture up on the wall. My husband is psyching himself up to doing the challenge on Tuesday! \\n\\nThe Attic might be a different name  but same location  great service  delicious food  and excellent beer selection.\"",

        "text": "\"I COMPLETELY agree with Sue! Let me count the ways...\\n\\nI began to start going to this Dr's office 4-5 years ago when they received a Top Doctors nod in the 2008 Phoenix Magazine  a nod I have not seen for them in some time. I made an appointment with Dr. Brown and was immediately pushed off onto the only Derm that seems to actually be there  Dr. Anngela Park.  I've seen her for a variety of skin issues  mole checks  acne  Accutane  etc. I have ALWAYS felt like a paycheck to the office  but didn't care because I didn't come there often.  It all started with the Accutane...\\n\\nAfter taking Accutane for 3-4 months  I began to realized that on my 6' frame  my joints were starting to hurt.  Like  REALLY HURT.  I did some research online and saw information stating that previous people who had taken Accutane had the same results with about  half returning to normal after cessation of Acctutane  and half keeping the pain.  As a 26 year old woman with no end to the acne in sight  I decided to continue with the Accutane until the 6 month mark and stop to see if my acne had subsided and stop the pain on my joints.  I mentioned this to Dr. Park in an appointment and she made a rather blanket statement to me saying that I was wrong. No evidence  no conversation other than \\\"\"\"\"I haven't seen that  so I don't agree.\\\"\"\"\" ?????? What???? Nothing in my life had changed  no other medications were being taken  no accidents happened  I didn't all the sudden start working out vigorously  I ate right and was doing what I had always been doing??? Being an educated young woman with a graduate degree  I hate being told that my beliefs are unfounded and are wrong  when no conversation takes place  no research is done  nothing.  If I make a statement and the Dr. says  \\\"\"\"\"No  you're wrong  I haven't seen that\\\"\"\"\"  that REALLY bothers me.  It tells me that just because you haven't seen it  it doesn't exist to you.  Poor  poor thinking as a medical professional.  \\nP.S. It was MOST DEFINITELY from the Accutane  and about 1.5 years later  the pain is VERY much still in my wrists at the bare minimum and I will probably have SERIOUS issues with those wrists  but I traded the pain of cystic acne for joint pain. What can you do?\\n\\nLet's also state that even when I go in to see them midday on a weekday  arriving ON TIME  I ALWAYS have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes. Once I had to wait 45 minutes during a lunch break for work where I had allotted just over an hour.  Driving to there  waiting for 45 mins  waiting in the back room for 10  seeing the Dr  for 5  and and driving back cost me AN HOUR AND A HALF. BAH!!!  This place has NO regard for timeliness and I believe I see less and less patients in the waiting rooms over the years #1 because of the economy  but #2 because nobody likes bull appointment times. \\n\\nThe final problem was the branchial cyst on my neck.  I had a small pinhead sized mass under the skin that was NO big deal  but whenever I got sick (flu  a viral infection  etc) it would swell up to the size of a shooter marble. It had been there for two years with no problems and then it swelled and HURT  BAD.  I made an appointment to come in for the first time in like a year or so.  Waiting in the waiting room for 15 minutes  (not a patient's soul in the waiting room or in the back?). I come up to pay my specialist fee of $40 before I may enter.  A sign should hang above the door stating \\\"\"\"\"Abandon all hope ye who enter here\\\"\"\"\" because do NOT expect any sort of a good experience.  \\n\\nI went to the back and waited for another 10 minutes while I heard the Dr. talk outside my paper thin door about personal things that could have waited with no other patients there  then proceeded to debrief the intern  loudly  about me outside my door. COME IN?! I can hear you  so at least ignore me in person when you talk about me. She comes in  checks me out  and says \\\"\"\"\"You're not going to like this\\\"\"\"\". \\n\\nDO NOT EVER START A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS IF YOU ARE A DOCTOR!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!!\\n\\nMy heart sinks  and she tells me... \\\"\"\"\"I can't remove that  you're going to have to see a specialist\\\"\"\"\". Then why  praytell  did I just pay a SPECIALIST $40 fee for you???? So basically she eludes to me to go somewhere else  I'm not getting my $40 back for her horrible advice. (Which consisted of the word \\\"\"\"\"Otolaryngologist\\\"\"\"\" scratched onto a piece of paper).  No names  no Dr.'s they work closely with.  Just making me pay $40 for what I could have found out online  but assumed your SPECIALISM would remove a 1cm cyst from just under the skin of my neck???  Then she proceeds to tell me that I need to see a family practice Dr. to get a referral.\\n\\nYEAH RIGHT!!!!!\\n\\nContinued on next review...\"",

I would give them zero stars if I could  they only get 1 star because they didn't charge to watch the fights and because they had a decent SELECTION of apps and drinks for happy hour. While the selection was decent  the food was NOT! \\n\\nThe \\\"\"\"\"blackened chicken\\\"\"\"\" nachos had an option to add guacamole for $1  this came as 1 sliver of avocado and a tiny bed of pico de gallo. The chicken was not blackened  in fact it had no seasoning or flavor at all...was more like boiled chicken breast. \\n\\nThe artichoke crab dip was salty (and I'm not shy about using salt when I cook) yet lacked any real flavor and wasn't good. \\n\\nThe buffalo chicken flatbread was ok. Nothing special  but better than the other items.\\n\\nThe loaded potato soup could've used some more chunks of potato and bacon  as well as some pepper. But still was decent compared to the rest of the food. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the chopped salad which said it came with ranch  yet when it arrived it had balsamic on it. She mentioned it to the waitress who replied \\\"\"\"\"no it doesn't come with ranch  it doesn't really come with a specific type of dressing.\\\"\"\"\" Then my friend says \\\"\"\"\"well on the menu it says it comes with ranch.\\\"\"\"\" The waitress grabs a menu to disprove this  only to realize that the menu does in fact say ranch. I know they've only been open 2 weeks  but the servers should know what the dishes come with...and if they're not sure  they definitely should NOT argue with the customer who just read the menu a few minutes ago. \\n\\nThey also removed the pool tables  air hockey  and dart board that ranch house used to have. On the plus side they still have beer pong tables  new ones in fact...which is an upgrade. \\n\\nOverall pretty terrible food  mediocre service  reasonably priced drinks during happy hour. If this is your idea of a good time  then check this place out! Otherwise  go eat at Tommy Bahama cafe and order the steak salad/carnitas sandwich/bourbon ribs and coconut pineapple cake/key lime pie/barbados brownie instead and grab some drinks at yard house after.\"",

Prepare to repeat your order several times. The DJ stopped the music periodically to insist all bars be filled with girls (both bartenders and patrons) who would then dance on the bar while the bartenders poured free \\\"\"\"\"shots\\\"\"\"\" directly into patrons' mouths.

It's also impossible to walk around because it's so crowded! The dance floor is also hard to move around! The music wasn't always so great though.

No menu at the table and had to ask the greeter to get menu.  Waited almost another 10 minutes for the water\\n\\nServer came and introduced himself  ordered a sago and lunch. I don't know if the prep work is different in the USA compared to the Philippines but it doesn't take long to pour the drink toss in the jello and tapioca ...the drink itself is really good and just like I would have back in Manila\\n\\nThe food itself was great...ordered garlic fried rice  half chicken and sisig\\n\\nHopefully they get it together so that the experience will match the food",

        "text": "\"Upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.  And now the details...\\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next  how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well  I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set  so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK  I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \\nThat is where things went sideways.  \\nThe \\\"\"\"\"warehouse\\\"\"\"\" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery  which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store  who got me the warehouse number.  When I called  I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \\nUpon assembly  they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\\\"\"\"\" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it  leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out  but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead  we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store  and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again  they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again  I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again  she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered  nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably  the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\\n\\nOverall  the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear)  the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp.\"",

Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously  I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision.\\nThe other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting  high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit.\\nThe food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good.\\nService was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens.\\nOne excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there  wherever it might be. \\nI hope that my fellow motorists  my family  and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley.

My boyfriend tried the braised short ribs which he described as melt in your mouth delicious. The Serrano hamachi dish was very inventive. This is usually one of my favorite dishes  but I've never seen it made with yuzu foam which made it outshine all the other places I've tried it at.

All the dishes were tantalizing to the taste buds.\\n\\nService: Our server was attentive  knowledgeable  and patient with our questions  and trust me we had a lot of them to answer. I don't know much about sake  but I wanted to try something new. The server gave me a quick 101 on the different sakes available which made it much easier for me to decide from. The managers came by and checked on us to make sure we had a good experience  which was really nice to see that everyone was eager to serve us well. Most of the things we ordered were recommendations from the server  and I'm glad she was so informative about the dishes. She also served us ginger coffee chocolates at the end of our meal that was complimentary.

While waiting for our takeout I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs go by and it looks amazing  something I will have to try next time. The only cons would be that it lacks in decor and is very small  but something that is easy to get over since the food is outstanding.

I was out in 6 1/2 hours.\\n\\nHere are some notes about my experience after getting my first DUI (slightest degree)  which required me staying In jail for 10 days  9 of which were suspended  meaning I needed to spend ONE day in jail.\\n\\nOne day to the jail is to be booked through the end of a 12 hour window (either noon to midnight or vice versa). Don't quote me on that but you'll understand my point of view shortly. I was to spend a day in jail so I thought I would go through self-surrender early in the morning to get out early the next day. I was informed by experiences others to go in late at night instead. I contacted the court (which will cost you $25 to change your incarceration date! - just one more fee...)  changed my time to 10pm self surrender and went in that night. \\n\\nWhen arriving  drive yourself if you can afford to (meaning my girlfriend and I share a car but she could survive if I ended up being stuck in jail for 24 full hours so I drove myself). There is free parking right outside the self surrender area. Park yourself  leave all other keys in your car. That way you don't need to give anything up  you can keep it all with you through your stay.\\nJust stand outside the giant door that says self surrender. They'll come and get you. Take an ID  a paperback book or magazine  and your car key in with you. It gets chilly once you're in the concrete jail for a good amount of time. I wore sweatpants over basketball shorts (in case I got warm) and a t-shirt with a light thermal over top of it and I was fine all evening. Actually took the thermal off and used it as a pillow to get some sleep.\\nIt took about half an hour standing in a room while they did a medical questionnaire with the med staff  got my fingerprints and mug shots taken  got my \\\"\"\"\"Jail ID\\\"\"\"\" and was then taken to the holding cell. It was probably 20' by 10' with two wall length concrete benches  one side shorter to accommodate a walled off toilet/sink in the back corner. The people you are with are either other one nighters or people that have served their sentence and are on their way out. Most people will be in pretty good spirits but if you're nervous just take a book and keep you nose in it. IF YOU BRING A BOOK  make it a non novel  something with short chapters or easy stop and go reading  as it's hard to focus with the relentless fluorescent light and talkative inmates. \\nAnyway  once I was booked and midnight came  the county got paid for having me as an inmate for 'the day' (2 12 hour periods) as I was incarcerated for the 18th from 9pm-11:59am and the 19th from 12am-3:30am  a portion of each counts as all for their purposes. Once midnight came  they started processing people out. I was re-fingerprinted and moved around to a few more cells but then it was over. You get asked some identifying questions by the sergeant and then you're released. \\n\\nDO NOT GET IN YOUR HEAD ABOUT THIS. It will be over before you know it. In summation:\\n-Reading material: bring a short chapter book  a funny quote book  book of lists  magazine etc\\n-Personal Belongings: nothing besides clothes on your back  a jacket  single car key and one paper back book or magazine\\n-Time of surrender: GO IN AT NIGHT or spend unnecessary time in a jail cell\\n-Interaction: Keep an open mind. You won't be placed with anyone dangerous  but with people on their way out so they will be on their best behavior (mostly) so they can get out of jail.\\n-Behavior: Listen intently when the officers speak and speak clearly when you speak. They deal with ignorant people all day and usually will have no patience for BS\\n\\nIf you have any other questions or concerns  ask around  do some research  but take everything with a grain of salt. I hope this helps someone at some point. Best of luck  criminal!\"",

Hmmm...sounded promising. \\n\\nMoving through this eclectic shop  I felt like Alice in Wonderland.\\n\\nThe front section gave me a flashback to university days when my German roommate would pick up specialty groceries at the European deli. So many interesting and delicious things from real French mayonnaise to Ricola teas to many many many kinds of chocolate. \\n\\nThe middle of the store had German and Swiss clocks of every scale imaginable. Cuckoo clocks  grandfather clocks  wall clocks  and even a case full of wearable clocks...oh yes  we call those watches.\\n\\nIn the back I found giant bears (of the stuffed animal variety) and tiny sports cars. My favourite item was a rocking horse but instead of a horse it was a plush elephant. Do you see why I was expecting to see mock turtles and the Red Queen at any moment?\\n\\nBut by far the best part of this store was picking my flavour of real hot chocolate.

I came here with a party of 11 to celebrate my aunt's birthday. I must say my aunt and her family are from NY and have eaten at the Carmine's there  so the expectations were set pretty high. I do love the inside of the place especially how the high raised ceilings have all sorts of pictures hanging on the walls. If only the restaurant was in a stand alone building then it would truly give that Manhattan feel. Before anything was served we noticed that the plates were at the end of the table  my aunt expected the server to place each plate in front of us because that's what the server did in NY. It didn't happen  so I guess here it's more of a self serve concept. My beverage of choice was the strawberry lemonade since another review mentioned how good and tart it was. She was right I did enjoy the tartness(tasted similar to Red Robbin's Freckled Lemonade)  too bad it's not free refill because I sure did finish that drink before the food was served.\\n\\nSo here is the break down of the food:\\n\\nCarmine's salad- I liked all the additional toppings in this salad like berries  nuts  and salami if I remember correctly. We had 2 salads and assumed they were the same because they looked very similar. After tasting both we realized the other one was a mixed green salad. I prefer Carmine's salad and say it's worth the $3 difference. \\n\\nCalamari- pretty standard  wasn't too greasy and the breading was like how I've had it at other Italian restaurants.   \\n\\nZuppa Di Clams (white)- I am not a fan of clams but my brother convinced me to try the last piece and I was pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy clams I definitely would recommend this dish  pretty delicious I must say. The sauce for the clams was so good we saved it to put on our pasta.\\n\\nBroiled porterhouse steak- this was really delicious and I thought it was perfectly cooked with various pieces being rare and medium (refer to the picture). One of the better cuts of steak I've had from a restaurant. Warning this is pricey  costing $80.\\n\\nChicken Scarpariello- I read from another review recommending this dish and when we ordered it the server said they were out?! I was shocked at first because I've never heard of a chicken dish running out at a restaurant. Thankfully she came back and said they still had it. It was cooked in a buttery sauce  probably my favorite dish of the night and reasonably price. I will definitely order this the next time I come back. \\n\\nThere was a pasta dish we ordered but I can't remember what the name was. Next time I come  I'll also order the Rigatoni & Broccoli as recommended by another yelper. According to my aunt and her husband the food was a little on the salty side  but still a good quality in comparison to the one in NY. However the service was lacking. I really want to come back but it probably won't be any time soon. This place was pricey so I'll have to find a special occasion to come here for.",

However  when I went along and tried some of the beers on offer  I was totally shocked at the prices being charged. Prices vary from around \\u00a36 to nearly \\u00a310 for a litre of beer! That is way more expensive than pub prices (as an average)  so I fail to see how this business can be a success going forward. Yes  I understand that dealing in small batches of beer and regularly changing the beers on offer  will add cost but if you get yourself to somewhere like Stewart Brewing at Loanhead you get draught beer to take away in bottles  in exactly the same way as Growler Beers of Morningside but Stewart's are around half the price with draft beer ranging from around \\u00a33.80 to less than \\u00a35. There can be no justification for this kind of extra cost being charged by Growler Beers and I think the owner needs to rethink his strategy  as every time I pass the shop  it is empty. It looks like the high prices are keeping the punters away! Oh and by the way  Stewart Brewing do some excellent beers!",

Not outstanding for the price  but acceptable. \\n\\nApproaching 45 minutes since our arrival  still no 2nd round and we hadn't ordered dinner. We made the decision to leave and a member of our party approached the manager.\\n\\nThe manager apologized (ok) and then proceeded to claim no knowledge of a problem (hmm)  blame us for not saying something sooner (not ok)  and then had the temerity to ask us to give his restaurant another try. FAIL. \\n\\nSorry  mate. The manager should know what's going on. When he sees apps on the table  menus still on the table  no app plates  no drinks and it's been a while... He should stop by and ask if we are ok.  Instead he didn't engage  and as a result he lost is as customers. \\nAnd I'm sharing our poor experience with other Yelpers in hopes that you won't suffer as we did. \\n\\nEpilogue: We walked to another restaurant in Mandalay Place  arriving a few minutes after 11. Within minutes we were seated  our drink order was promptly filled and food was quickly served. We finished  happily full  at 11:45.  Rx Boiler Room  take that as a lesson on how to serve customers.",

They are so bad that this basically constitutes a flat-out lie. \\n\\nThe \\\"\"\"\"business center with multiple work stations\\\"\"\"\" is two small rooms open during office business hours - so it's useless if you  say  come home from work at 6 and want to use the business center to print something out. That'd be okay  though  if the computers actually worked. They are terrible  dated  slow machines that are practically useless. At least half the time  they literally don't work (which is tough luck for a lot of residents  as there seem to always be residents there *trying* to use the machines). When I say \\\"\"\"\"don't work \\\"\"\"\" I don't mean they are slow - I mean they literally do not work (the screen won't turn on  the keyboard doesn't work  etc). When they work  they are slow and filled with old  insecure software like ancient versions of internet explorer. Don't access anything private on them. \\n\\nThe java bar is a single keurig machine with extremely low-stocked supplies and virtually no variety. It's located in the middle of the leasing office  which makes it kind of weird if you actually do want to use it - you have to randomly go in someone's office and use their stuff. If it were really intended for resident use and benefit  it'd be located 10 feet away in the resident's clubhouse. \\n\\nMy two star review is based on the fact that the management company lies about amenities and thinks its okay to do that. Living here is fine (other than the falsely advertised amenities)  but for the money you may as well go to one of the much nicer Ovation properties. (No  I don't work for ovation. I'm just sick of attempting to use the Mosaic \\\"\"\"\"amenities\\\"\"\"\" to print something and not being able to because the machines and maintenance are horribly bad).\"",

The 4-stars is based solely on value  as in  you don't get much of it. \\n\\n5-5-0 seems to be a theme here. $5.50 will get you a generous slice of pie. Forager is my favorite. Seriously  I will go to Aria to eat this pizza. It has whipped ricotta which is delicious and a nice spattering of mushrooms  spinach and bacon  at least they don't skimp on the toppings. Crust is great  perfect NY-style and I like the white sauce they use too. Overall  it's a great pie  if not one of the best in LV. \\n\\nI tried the Gotham  Margherita and what seems to be their Vegetarian (I can't find it on their menu but it had zucchinis as a topping). Honestly  for $5.50 a slice  it wasn't worth it. It was a great pie but you can get one just as good for a lot less. \\n\\nThe 4-stars is for the outrageous prices. Yeah  it's the Strip  blah  blah... but it's $5.50 for a NY-style slice  which you'll have to buy two to make it a meal. Then beer is $8  and water (there is no free water) is another $4. I usually spend around $15 here for lunch and there's no place to sit  just standing-only tables. The best way to minimize the gouge is to bring your own drink from outside and only order one slice.

There was a line to get in when we arrived  so we ended up waiting about 15 minutes or so. Ask to be seated at the counter  so you watch them prepare the food.\\n\\nEdible menus - ok  cute.

But really  the 3 course meal is a score so it's your preference  we're just fatties like that. \\n\\nI loved every dessert we tried. EVERYTHING. Each was amazing in their own way  but the Red Rock (lava flow) was one of my favorites and tops it on my list of favorite desserts.

But it is wroth the wait. Also  the desserts are $12 for just the entree and $19 for the 3 course. The chef is from Japan and if anyone knows anything about the Japanese  they're talented when it comes to food and what makes it perfect for my palate is that they know how to use sugar and not let the sugar be the main object of the piece.

Halfway through my salad  I notice what appeared to be a dark piece of lettuce  so I proceed to pick it up to take it out of my salad. That's when I noticed that it wasn't lettuce  but a dead moth. Now.... I have worked in the food industry for quite a long time... I understand that bugs can get into food and that it's not always something that a restaurant can avoid... But this thing was huge. I was so completely and utterly disgusted  I walked out of the building and told my boyfriend to talk to management. They refunded me for the salad  but not the meal my boyfriend had or my drink. \\n\\nI called the next day to discuss the situation and explain to them that I was dissatisfied with the customer service I received... I would have appreciated a manager apologizing to me or even just talking to me about it. I also believe that I should have been refunded for our entire order... Something as horrific as finding a giant dead moth in your meal cannot be forgotten or forgiven by simply refunding the customer for the salad. When I spoke to a manager  they suggested that I could come to the store and receive another salad on the house- which I respectfully declined. \\n\\nHorrible experience that I will never forget :/",

What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking  Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet  I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\\n\\nOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas  apps  well drinks  and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty  not bready  and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces  not a bunch of lumpy  gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\\n\\nOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\\n\\nWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella  Tomato Sauce  Sliced House Link Sausage  Garlic  Pepperoni  Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says  \\\"\"\"\"Winner  Best Traditional  Las Vegas\\\"\"\"\". I'm not sure what that means.\\n\\nOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition  creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \\\"\"\"\"normal\\\"\"\"\" pizza  but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\\n\\nFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious  I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya  go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount  unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\\n\\nOther things I want to go back for:\\n\\nTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\\nClam and Garlic Pizza\\nLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\\nQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\\nCal Italia (again  this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\\nThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\\nAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\\n\\nLooks  like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is  I am so happy there is a good  inventive pizza place so close to where I live now.\"",

It's always a pleasant experience to dine here because everyone is so nice  and the service is wonderfully efficient. Move on to the food  shall we? Simply delicious. From the hot  fresh pita & creamy hummus  to the chicken kebabs / shawarma; and everything in between that I've tried  it's all fresh & yummy. If you're a vegetarian  fret not  because they have some terrific veg options as well. As you scroll through the menu  you may get over ambitious and want to order everything  but refrain from doing that because their entree portions are quite large  and you don't want to fill yourself up so much that you miss out on the assorted baklava & tea for dessert ;) The ambiance of the restaurant is casual; it's simple  clean and comfortable. Go check 'em out  and you'll be dreaming of kebab je too!",

You are required to stand in line to order your food  all the while standing by the bar and beer taps. At first awkward  however  the move is genius. For all of us beer fiends out there  this is your perfect chance to order a brew and sip on it in line while cashing out at the bar.\\n\\nSecondly  while you're in line they bring around samples of their milkshakes. \\\"\"\"\"Do you want a free sample of our vanilla bean milkshake?\\\"\"\"\" Uhhh  yes I do  thank you very much. \\n\\nThird  the burgers are awesome. Perfectly sized and cooked just right  they come a-la-carte and you're going to have to order your fries separately  but they're large enough to share. My go-to when I'm at Hopdoddy is the Goodnight Burger (add bacon and make it a \\\"\"\"\"Great\\\"\"\"\"night)  with the truffle fries. Do yourself a favor and pick up some of their homemade BBQ sauce for dipping  its delicious. Don't forget to follow everything up with their salted caramel milkshake. They give you an extra large straw so you're almost guaranteed to get a brain freeze - totally worth it.\\n\\nThe great thing about the madness of ordering through the line when you first arrive is that you get a \\\"\"\"\"server\\\"\"\"\" to take care of you once you've sat down and when you're done eating you've already paid (unless you got dessert or another beer - womp womp)!

Give me a burger  fries (and maybe even a milkshake) and I'm one happy girl. Granted  I don't eat my favorite meal every day of the week  which is why it's such a special treat when I do. Being a huge fan of Roaring Fork and Salty Sow  I was very excited to give Hopdoddy Burger Bar a try. The verdict? Folks  they did it again! \\n\\nHere's how it works: \\n\\nThere are three ways to enjoy a meal here. You can post up at the bar  you can dine in or you can get take out. Whichever option you chose  you will start by first going up the counter and ordering your meal. If you plan on dining in  once you order  the server shows you to a seat so you don't have to fight other patrons to score a table. The server will then bring the food out to you and you can enjoy your meal! \\n\\nNow on to the food. The burgers are why you come here  but they do have other delicious food as well! I especially love the Classic Cheeseburger and french fries  but the cous cous is delicious  as is the Kale Salad with Baby Kale Leaves  Arugula  Feta  Watermelon  Avocado  Sunflower Seeds  Pickled Red Onions and Pomegranate Vinaigrette. Actually  all of there salads looked delicious. While I love the Classic  they also have several funky burger options  such as the Buffalo Bill with Bison  Blue Cheese  Frank's Hot Sauce  Apple-Smoked Bacon  Sassy Sauce  the El Diablo with Angus Beef  Pepper Jack  Caramelized Onions  Habanero and Serrano Chiles  Salsa Roja  Chipotle Mayo  an Ahi tuna burger  turkey burger and veggie burger  etc  etc. There's a burger for all palettes here! \\n\\nNow let me talk about my other favorite part of the meal. Mmmmm....milkshakes! Oh yes  they have milkshakes here and a.m.a.z.i.n.g ones at that! I had the Nutella and Chocolate pretzel and yes my friends  it's as good if not better than it sounds. I might just stop in for a milkshake one of these days  but then I don't think I could resist a burger to go with it!",

I am a bit behind on my review writing so I will try to include the highlights  or lowlights as it may be  from my memory. I was eagerly anticipating a spectacular birthday lunch based upon the reviews and the pictures taken. Unfortunately  I was sadly dissapointed and actually left hungry  which is saying a lot for an AYCE place. There were only a couple other tables there at lunch. There was only one waiter which made service incredibly and painfully slow. In anticipation of how long it would take to get our order  as we thought the response time from when we sat down was indicative of the service  we ordered a mass amount of sushi initially - probably 4 orders of nigiri  4 hand rolls and three cut rolls. There were four of us. Waiter consistently forgot about 1/3 of our orders. My friend must have requested the same hand roll about four times and still didn't get it by the time we left. Also  the specials on the board were not available at lunch - so be careful this was one of the reasons we came were some of the specials. The fish to rice ratio was decent but if they forget 1/3 of your orders I am sure they can afford to cut the rice down on what they serve. The sushi in and of itself was okay  nothing memorable and pretty standard. I would avoid \\\"\"\"\"the shit\\\"\"\"\" despite the accolades provided by other yelpers it was nothing more than a fried mess. After about two hours of fighting through this horrible experience we finally left - we didn't get dessert because we were on \\\"\"\"\"lunch\\\"\"\"\" and were already really late and just couldn't take the agonizing service anymore. It was the perfect storm of forgetful slow waiter  slow sushi chef and being understaffed. I dont' know if the other yelpers came at night and the staff gears it up for the evening but my experience is one I hope to never repeat again in my life. Also  be warned that they didn't provide soda fountain drinks  if you buy a soda it is just a can. Also  the green iced tea is not brewed (despite the representation that it was) and is merely a mix  this was apparent by not only the taste but the mix floating around in the drink. \\n\\n So so sad that I wasted my birhday lunch here...\"",

This completely flummoxed the young woman working the register  but after a couple of confused looks one of the guys making a sandwich said something to her and she put the order in.\\n\\nNext up  I ordered a #2  also with hot peppers. She repeated my order back to me  even as she got it wrong on the register.\\n\\nMy husband received his sandwich with maybe 3 hot peppers on it. My sandwich had none  and the receipt showed she didn't include it when she rang us up.\\n\\nEverything about the people working there just screams \\\"\"\"\"NEW!!!!\\\"\"\"\" right now. I had to ask her to give me a cup for the drink I ordered after she just turned away from us to help the next customer. The wait for our sandwiches wasn't long but it was comical watching the guy behind the counter reposition each of our sandwiches several times  moving it by millimeters precisely before wrapping it.\\n\\nThis was the worst experience we've had at Jimmy John's. I've never had them get my order wrong before. It wasn't a TERRIBLE experience in the grand scheme of things  but it's definitely below the standards I've seen in their Pineville store. I'll give this new location another chance  but not for another month or two so the staff gets a chance to learn how to ring up orders correctly.\"",

The first impression this place left on me was...well   that fishy smell  not off to a good start....... Myself and a few co-workers stopped here for lunch. As it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago. I figured they would have their best foot forward.  Sure hope that was not the case. \\n\\nCant remember the name of the server  we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit. 1) bring water and take order 2) drop off food 3) drop off check.  Now let me clarify  I do not expect to be served like a king  I am not a nose up type of person. However  when we had to ask for a re-fill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walking by  then I started to question the service.\\n\\nThis brings me to the food. Part of the drink re-fill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty. We were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food. The fried soft shell crab was not very impressive  scrawny little guys  90% shell/breading  5% meat  5% grease/salt. The fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either. The potato salad was pretty good. \\n\\nI will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days. Im just hoping that this was an off day and not the standard at Crab Corner.",

On our way home we looked for the closest vape shop to buy juice for the drive. We really just walked in on a whim with an idea of the juice we wanted and every intention to make a quick fast exit. \\nWhen we asked for Riptide Pink Spot juice  they had just sold out of the 6 nicotine bottle; however the friendly owners told us they'd do us one better and make us their own blend of riptide with their own ingredients. We were intrigued  but had to get on the road fast so we told them that we might not have the time. The man told us he'd whip it up for us in two minutes. As he went in back to create the final product  I asked the lady about their store brand juice. She informed me that they use a less balanced percentage of PG and VG (typically its 50/50) but that it makes for a better cloud. She also told me that they use no extra fillers and their juice is simple and pure  flavoring  nicotine and pg and vg. She was really friendly and I didn't feel like she was trying to sell me on her product  she just seemed to be really confidant that theirs was really good and stood out above the rest. She also gave us a great deal on some extra pink spot flavors. The man returned with a glass bottle and their \\\"\"\"\"I Heart Vape\\\"\"\"\" logo on the bottle. We made small conversation as they rung us up  and they were really nice people. \\n\\nWe got in the car and dripped this homemade juice into our vape  and surprise! it was awesome! It was even BETTER than Pink Spot's rip tide and made a really big cloud. I was super impressed! Just to be sure I wasn't imagining this  I dripped some Pink Spot into the vape after it needed to be refilled  and could defintly tell the difference between the two. The I Heart Vape juice tasted much cleaner  less chemically  and was all around delicious. \\n\\nI don't typically write reviews for Vape shops  but I was so impressed by this one. I hope we can get some I Heart Vape Juice in California shops soon! All the best of success to your shop!\"",

For my entree  I decided to go with a class Short Leash special  the Sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit  goat cheese  prosciutto and arugula. It's one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients. Besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today  this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders. They also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog! \\n\\nAs for the environment  it's very neighborhood friendly. Everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables. Be prepared to dine with a couple strangers (who might become new-found friends!) if you come during peak hours. If you don't feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table  then I suggest that you eat at the bar. It's simple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it. Brad and Kat's friendly personality comes to life as Brad welcomes you inside while Kat cooks up a storm in the back. \\n\\nI am so happy that this successful food truck has turned into an adorable restaurant. Their food  service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant! I will happily return again soon to get my Short Leash fix. \\n\\n***** \\nAfter dining on our hot dogs  we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food truck success story  Mamma Toledo who opened up The Pie Hole next door. Look for that review coming up next!",

And when I say huge  I mean they took up like half the restaurant. I knew we were going to have somewhat of a wait because there were no plates in front of them. There wasn't a sign that said to seat yourself  so we waited by the counter. There was a man behind the counter talking to another man (one of the patrons) and I'd say it took a good FIVE minutes for him to even acknowledge us..... and we were standing right in front of him. My boyfriend gave me the \\\"\"\"\"let's just walk out\\\"\"\"\" look but this place has been blasting my IG newsfeed so I wanted to see the hype. \\n\\nWhen we were finally able to order  there was a list of stuff they had ran out of  so we had to rethink our decisions. (ugh) We waited a good 20-25 minutes for our food but it was nice and piping hot. The curry was OK. I think we prefer Indian curry so it may just be a preference thing. My BF ate the food  but I don't think he'll want to eat it again. The concept is great and they offer very creative toppings and sides to go along with the curry  but like I said  it may just be a preference thing. I would give the food a 3/4 but have to downgrade to a 2 because of the initial service. Perhaps I'll visit again and update after.....\"",

I can tell you that Kaba Curry is the first Curry House to hit Las Vegas. \\n\\nWith a spacious venue I am not rubbing elbows with people while trying to eat or bumping the chairs of other people trying to get to the restroom to wash my hands.\\n\\nIts priced reasonably for the average foodie. There are a lot of topping/ side selections to choose from so you can be creative with your own dish.

I was excited to finally get over there to try the place. \\n\\nFirst off  the space is way too small for a Smashburger. I don't know why they thought they could cram one into this teeny tiny space. I would avoid coming here during popular meal times because there would be nowhere to sit. They are severely lacking in seating space and tables. Another problem is their huge windows mean more than half of the seating is made unusable when the sun is hitting them just right. You will be blinded or roasting from the solar rays. They have pull down shades but they do a poor job of blocking out the sun. The layout of the place is funky as well  with their fountain drink machine located in this weird corner  causing big bottlenecks when customers are trying to fill their drinks. (Bonus points for having Coke Zero  though). \\n\\nThe girl taking our orders was very slow and confused but I'm guessing this is just because the place recently opened. As always  I'll go back in a few weeks to see if they've ironed out some of the kinks. The kitchen was FAST  much faster than any other Smashburger I've ever been to. This sort of worried me and I expected my burger to taste crappy or my order to be incorrect -- but it wasn't!\\n\\nMy burger was exactly how I ordered it and it was good! It didn't look that tasty but it tasted great. I was very happy. Most of you know I'm a low carb eater so I love when a place doesn't blink twice when I ask for \\\"\"\"\"no bread or bun.\\\"\"\"\" Sometimes it's too difficult for people to understand and my burger comes out on a bun anyway. Here it was SUPER EASY. In fact  the kitchen even served my burger on two slices of lettuce so I could make them into a \\\"\"\"\"bun\\\"\"\"\" if I wished (see my photo). I LOVED THIS! THEY EARNED AN EXTRA STAR JUST FOR THIS!\\n\\nPremium add-ons like bacon and avocado will cost you $1 each. I'm totally bummed that they have removed the chili from their menu.

I paid an extra $50 for this. He claims I never told him it was a salt system ( a lie). I have asked him many times to rectify the situation. He has not responded. I highly regret doing business with this company.",

We arrived at noon on the dot and were pleasantly surprised to see the sake tasting that was available for us. I have to admit we spent quite a lot of time trying nearly every sake available. This alone was worth the price of admission. \\n\\nFinally  it was time to take our seats and indulge in a heavenly smorgasbord that was presented to us. They started slow with the chicken yakitori and shishito pepper and mushroom skewers with bonito flakes as an appetizer. Then came our amuse of lemon snow ice with frozen grapes. It was delightful and so light and subtle. Great way to tease our tastebuds for what was about to come. Next was the hamachi which was accompanied with serrano peppers and grapefruit. Nice and spicy but still very refreshing and flavorful. The scallop with melon snow ice was next and it was delicious. Very interesting and innovative dish. The fried bun was insane and blew me away for a bit. This was my second favorite course of the lunch. \\n\\nThere was a bit of a lull while we waited for our next servings and we took the opportunity to chat with our tablemates and get a few more tastes of sake. Finally  we took our seats again and the next course was presented. The whole Mediterranean snapper arrived at our table and everyone's eyes bulged right out of their heads. We were shocked to see a whole fish for every four people. Fantastic. The skin was spectacular and so flavorful. My favorite dish of the meal. The yucca chips were pretty addictive as well. I could eat these instead of potato chips any day.  Large portions of braised pork with egg  cashews and served with a side of rice and tempura were also served at this time. This is when the gluttony reached a peak. Just when we didn't think we could eat another bite the desserts arrived and they didn't disappoint at all. Green tea snow ice with fried milk  chocolate infused with green tea  balsamic strawberry puree  strawberry paper and milk dust. This was the perfect finale to our four hour brunch. \\n\\nI can't sing the praises of this event enough. It was beyond my wildest dreams and I can't wait to attend another of these now monthly meals again really soon. Thank you to everyone and Yonaka and Snow Shavery for a lunch to end all lunches.",

I ate at the restaurant on December 5  and the management falsely claimed that the Groupon was expired. Beyond the manipulative dishonesty of the management  the food was very mediocre IMHO.  The chicken teriyaki was a frozen skinless boneless chicken breast like you would buy by the bag at costco or sams club  cooked barely long enough to no longer be raw  with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  the vegetables were steamed but also with no flavoring or seasoning whatsoever.  The salmon teriyaki was the same story.  The yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction  too much salty seasoning.  The decor is very nice  and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe  but the mediocre food and bad Groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  We won't be back.",

        "text": "\"This isn't our first art entertainment rodeo. We have been to other similar venues across the country and were excited to try the Art Party Studio in Champaign last night because we enjoyed the others so much.  Sadly  we were disappointed.\\n\\nLet's start with the positives:\\n\\n- Unlike other venues  in Champaign it is a BYOE (Everything - drinks and food) which wasn't a problem for us  since it gave us the flexibility of bringing what we wanted to drink.  Everything else was fairly similar. \\n\\n- The studio were set up fairly nicely  aprons were provided  and the artist's canvas was shown live on a big screen TV above the stage so that everyone could see what she was doing  which was a very nice touch that we had not seen before. \\n\\n- The studio was well lit  and had a very nice atmosphere. \\n\\n- each person attending the event had an easel set up with a canvas that had a pattern drawn on it  paints prepared on a paper plate  and water and brushes. It was nice not to have to get all of that for ourselves before the class started  as there would have been a traffic jam with all of the people around the paint area.\\n\\n- We were greeted when we walked in by a very nice gentleman who ensured that we were set up and understood what would be happening.\\n\\nThen the fun began. Or  rather  it was supposed to. Here are the disappointing parts:\\n\\n- when the painting was about to begin  the instructor got onstage  and just jumped right in. There was no banter  chitchat  introduction  or discussion on what would be happening that night. Just straight to business. It felt awkward and uncomfortable  and didn't start the night out on a positive note.\\n\\n- The instructor demonstrated what we would be doing  but neglected to tell us key points about what techniques to use or what to avoid until it was too late. This happened multiple times through the night  almost at every step of the way. It is very frustrating to find out what not to do after you've already done it  and now you've been told how it will mess up your painting.\\n\\n- when I ran out of blue paint I asked for more (the paint jars were not set up to be a help yourself - no labels or anything) and was given a stern look by the instructor after she checked my plate to ensure I really did need more. I was given a little more  and was told that if I needed more I needed to water it down so that the paint would go farther. Later  when I asked for a second paper plate to mix colors  I was told I didn't need another  and that I could mix the colors over the colors I had on my first plate. Seriously? We paid $60 to be given a canvas  some paint  some instruction  but most of all a fun night. Being lectured about paint usage and an extra paper plate really dampened the vibe. Are we in elementary school again?\\n\\n- We were never checked on  or asked if we needed any help or were doing okay. This was unusual compared to other studios. Questions to the instructor were answered  but after a few unenthusiastic answers people just stopped asking questions. The only time the instructor circulated through the room was when she had her camera out to take what she called her PR photos. Frustration and photos do not mix well.\\n\\n- overall we felt like our creativity was stifled - we were constantly reminded of the \\\"\"\"\"right\\\"\"\"\" way the painting should look as opposed to being encouraged to put our own mark on our pieces  down to using the right colors in the right places and the requirement of painting the sides of the canvas. \\n\\nWe left the event with two very similar looking pieces  as did everyone else. The night felt rushed  especially after the event when the instructor told us to clean up and then immediately began putting materials away. This vibe ensured that no one stayed to chat or enjoy the night. \\n\\nIt would have been a great and needed  addition to Champaign / Urbana entertainment  but was really not fun enough for repeated visits. Too bad.\"",

They showed up exactly at midnight on a Sunday and left damaged furniture that I tried to refuse.  They were supposed to send someone back the next day to pick up.  It has now been 4 days and I have taken 2 days off work for their so called scheduled pickup times only for them not to show up.  Absolutely ridiculous!!!  I lost more money in wage from unpaid work time then this was worth!",

Seriously the foam inside was different used and dirty.\\n\\nTechnicians they send to your house don't even know what they are doing and they don't speak highly of their own company. No and I mean no customer service at all. They play games with you on the phone. They use super nice statements and happy tones to try to calm you down before your even upset. Then they state policies and try to get you off the phone ASAP. I guess this is why the stores don't have direct phone numbers. \\n\\nBottom line. This company only cares about money and not you! \\n\\nThis was the worst shopping and customer service experience of my life. The products are no good. Spend a few extra bux and go somewhere that sells quality. When making large purchases customer service and peace of mind is worth every penny.",

My store experience with Barbara Walters  yes that's her name  as my sales person she was absolutely wonderful and patient as my husband and I shopped for over 3 hours. In the end I purchased over $7000 of furniture at the Scottsdale location.\\n\\nMy delivery window today Sunday was from 12 to 6 PM. At 9 AM I received a call from the delivery driver to let me know he was ahead of schedule and would be at the house in 45 minutes to an hour. I was actually okay with this because I'm a huge Chicago fan and the bears are playing the Packers today which for anybody who knows anything about football is a huge deal. With the new delivery time I would miss maybe half the first quarter  that I can handle. So I rushed out of my current home to my New home where the furniture is to be delivered to meet the driver. Well it's now noon and still no driver.\\n\\nI believe living spaces outsources their furniture delivery. They should seriously consider bringing this in-house even at a higher cost. Because of this experience I will not purchase any more furniture from living spaces. I have a large line of credit and a nearly empty home so this is a loss for them.\\n\\nThe quickest way to piss off a Chicagoan is to cause them to wait for hours in a home with no television during a Bears Packers game. Once my furniture arrives  I will update the review if I feel any differently. Considering it's now noon and I was called almost 3 hours ago I highly doubt anything will change unless this guy shows up with an iPad with 4G and the game on SundayTicket already streaming.",

If I could give ZERO stars I would.  \\n\\nI have a sofa which has had to go back three times now to repair a seam on the back frame that keeps splitting open.  It came back the last time with the seam repaired however the seam is now crooked and looks horrible.  My case got escalated to the Supervisor level (finally) and I was told yesterday that they feel it has been repaired correctly and there is nothing else they can do for me.  I might not care so much if the sofa was up against a wall  however it floats in my room and the crooked seam is constantly visible.  All other seams on the sofa are perfect.\\n\\nI am very disappointed that Living Spaces is not going to make this right by me.  I paid $1700.00 for a sofa that has a visible crooked seam that they tell me has been fixed appropriately.  I have had guests in my home ask me what happened to my sofa.\\n\\nI have been very patient throughout this process (it had to go back three times for repairs)  but now I am extremely upset.

Selection was not very good  I guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and that's it! Food is very dry  over cooked and very few selection. The only dessert are jello (my daughter made a comment that it's like a square gummy!) have a few fruits  a pudding  no cakes or cookies. They have that soft serve ice cream. I'm pretty sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks. We left like 1pm and they couldn't even fill up half the place. They are not open for dinner. That's why they charge so much it's not for the food but to pay for their rent. My suggestion go to Krazy Buffet (By Sahara and Cimarron) or Buffet@Asia (they have a couple of branches but the best one was at Spring Mountain and Sahara. You won't even have to pay $10 for lunch and the food is way better than over here (10x way better!) Save your money and just eat at Panda Express  you'll be very pleased! Never coming back here.

My wife and I ordered the grilled hotwings  better than moms meatloaf  and a burger and a couple of beers. Simple barfood right? Our tab was almost $60.00 including a standard tip. The staff was appropriately dressed and was professional. \\n\\nLets start with the appetizer. The hot wings were on the small side  even though they were advertised as being large and you only got 6 wings. The presentation was very nice  however I am in a bar and was not expecting great presentation. I was expecting value  which I did not receive paying more than $1.00/ wing.\\n\\nNext the entree.... The better than moms meatloaf was $17.00!. I ordered it anyway since my mom made some incredible meatloaf and wanted to see what the offering was. GREATLY Disappointed. The meatloaf came in 2 pieces and was very small. The meat was topped with an inedible garnish  but it was everywhere so it impossible for you not to get some of it in your mouth. Mashed potatoes were good and so were the steamed vegetables. Their mom had to be a horrible cook because i would not consider it better than the fare my mom served on Thursdays. \\n\\nMy wife's meal was a little better  but how can you really mess up a hamburger. The fries had a funny taste to them  as if they were making funnel cake in the same oil... \\n\\nOverall I left the place feeling I got ripped off.

I struggled a little bit on whether to give them three or four stars (3.5 would have been perfect score but yelp doesn't do halves) but since everyone involved seemed to really enjoy themselves I couldn't help to give them the benefit of the doubt. It was very well organized and despite not being able to pick up my packet early (I live in Rock Hill  too far to drive to Concord twice) picking it up the day of the race was simple\\\\easy ($5 charge was a little too capitalistic for my taste but still cheaper than the gas I would have spent driving to packet pick up) The cost to run this 5k is a little pricey considering all you get is a cotton tshirt and a race bib but I didn't feel like it was a rip-off because I did feel like I was on a real life game show and that's not an easy thing to produce. The start music was great and the obstacles are designed to be fun yet some where slightly challenging. The gorilla bars  the get up and over and even getting up most of the slides requires some upper body and leg strength. The moon bounce  foam slide and tarzan swing were more pure entertainment. The wrecking ball  jumpy balls (darn near impossible to do) and sweeper were the only obstacles that had any real element of danger\\\\failure to them. Cool running's was by far the fan favorite as people kept going back to repeat it (going down a slide on a inner tube)  The tire mile was really pointless afterthought that could be taken out for something the better. The big slide at the end was fun too but by then I was almost tired of the slides. I think they could have taken out the drop and tire mile for the tight rope transverse and the aqua drag (other obstacles they have done in other cities but didn't do in Charlotte as they only pick 12) and that would have added enough variety to keep it from feeling redundant. The end felt sort of anticlimactic as there was no celebration afterwards outside of the foam photo place which was cold and crowded at times. Not much in the way in food or prizes. And for once at the drink stations at the mile markers  can we get some actual COLD water\\\\sport drinks? Seriously that nasty water out the hose almost made me gag. I'm surprised a drink vendor sponsor wouldn't want to market their product for a bunch of thirsty participants. At the end of the day  people were having a good time. I was running with a group of about 8-9 people and that is the way to go. The more the merrier  get dressed up  act silly  laugh at each other  keeping everybody motivated when you get tired. Don't go out there trying to take yourself serious or be a loner or you will be sorely disappointed.

To begin with we were not greeted by our server until about 10 minutes after being seated. She was seemed very bored and did not give off a very pleasant vibe. We ordered some beers  and looked over the menu which had a tremendous amount of good sounding items. The beer was warm and flat  but the waitress said that they were having issues with their tap system  and finished by not offering a substitution when we brought it to her attention. We ordered our food  and when it eventually made it to our table it did not have one bit of wow factor. The candied bacon (man candy)was too sweet to taste any of the bacon  the bacon wrapped poppers were overcooked  and the chili cheese fries had a lot to be desired.

Yes  everything is FRESH! The assembly line style ordering starts with hand stretched dough  then goes to toppings which are thoughtfully dotted on your pizza. Be sure to ask them to brush the fresh garlic oil on first  it makes it. Then the crust gets seasoned before it goes into the bright red HOT oven that bakes your pizza in 90 seconds!  At that speed why would anyone pay MORE and wait longer for average delivery pizza?\\nWe also love getting either a burrata or caprese salad with our pizza. I can't seem to find burrata in most Italian restaurants  now I can get it at my local pizza joint! Oh happy day! \\nThe pizza has a nice chewy thin crust with bubbled charred areas  sauce is light and a little bit wet (but I don't mind) the cheese is perfectly melted and doesn't have that pool of grease from processed cheeses. We usually share a regular pizza between the 2 of us but you can eat an entire pizza and not feel that bad because it is so light. I wouldn't wait too long to eat your pizza because it does get soggy from the sauce.\\nThe burrata is very creamy and rich  and it does fill you up a little. The other times  we opt for the caprese salad which is much lighter. 5 simple ingredients mozzarella  tomato  basil  balsamic and EVO...delicious.\\nNow I'm accustomed to paying a bit of a premium for a pizza and salad at Grimaldi's  but at Novecento's our bill for a salad and pizza is usually around $20...what a deal and we don't have to worry about taking home leftover pizza and the whole car reaking of garlic.",

The broth was similar to Sichuan beef noodle soup (which I liked because of the slight spiciness and the taste of chili bean sauce). They probably also added star anise () in there so it tasted more like simmered beef but tasty. The beef chunks were a little bit thin in size  but were tender. However  the noodles  although were widened (which I preferred)  were a little overcooked. It was kinda soggy. This was my first time eating here so I do not know if they consistently cook this way  but I would just buy it to go and buy noodles at MeKong plaza and cook myself some decent noodles to eat with its decent beef broth. Overall  pretty impressed with the broth.\\n\\nMy friends had pork chop rice plate and Tainan DanZai noodles. The pork chop  was decent looking and came in good portion (compare to Taiwan food express). DanZai noodles was small in portion and tasted a little bland (though that's how it should be).\\n\\nI would say their food is not perfect to the standard of authentic Taiwanese food  but it's definitely your go-to place if you are craving for some Taiwanese food.

I'm southern and finding good ice tea (even with vodka added) in vegas is a gamble. good luck!",

My first time here a few weeks back was much better  even though the place was packed  we received constant  excellent service. Tonight was a totally different experience. We ordered an app and two pizzas  waited at least thirty-five minutes  app never showed. When the pizzas arrived we asked that the app be cancelled. Our server came back to say the pizzas just cooked faster than our little dumpling app (really??). I can forgive a mistake (like if someone forgets to put our app order in...) but I don't like being lied to. She proceeded to say that it was being cooked and that the manager would swing by and 'take care of it'. We never saw such manager  our server only checked on us once  and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I love the feel of this new Sammy's but one cannot live on ambiance alone. There's a small mom & pop pizza spot down the street from home that always delivers on the service front. I'd rather give them my business no matter how meager it may seem.

I went with my mom to try this place out because my mom is always down to eat Korean or Japanese food with me  so why not right? I heard about this place from some other yelpers and I was not disappointed! \\n\\nOne thing I saw pictures of was grinding your own sesame seeds and putting in your sauce or something  so I was curious. What you do is grab a bowl  put in some sesame seeds  and you grind it yourself! You can grind it to the consistency of your desire and I thought this was a fun little activity to do while we waited for our food. \\n\\nI ordered some karaage with my mom  and surprisingly  it was not greasy or too oily  it was actually really good. The outside was really crispy and the inside was soft. This is a highly recommended appetizer! When our actual entrees came out  it comes with the meat you ordered  rice  soup  and a salad. I ordered the pork and I don't remember the name of it because there were two pork katsu items with different names... But they are the same thing  that's what the server told me. I was confused and so I ended up getting whatever that was. My mom got the chicken and my mom got double the meat I did it seemed  for a dollar less. Nothing to complain about there  just get the chicken next time! Like saw their combos  but from the pictures  I didn't think the extra piece of shrimp was worth the 5 bucks  so I passed. \\n\\nThe food was amazing my gosh! The breading was so crispy and the meet was tender and juicy. This is definitely the place to get your katsu fix!

Yes the redesign in the apartment is nice  but don't be fooled. Everything  and I mean everything is cheap. Before I even used the dishwasher  it was broken and I had to have someone come and fix it. Everything in the apartment looked like the workers didn't care for detail. Paint lines uneven and on door knobs  old nails left in wall  uneven colored concrete floors and borders  half hanging on popcorn ceilings.. Everything is cheap and was done poorly. Once I had a friend over and we were just sitting on the couch and water started leaking from the ceiling!! I ran and got the worker guy and when we came back it had stopped so he didn't even try to find out what was the issue so it happened again of course. Also I did not appreciate the water being shut off all the time  most of the time with no prior notice until of course I complained.\\n Neighbors and construction are constantly noisy and the smell of weed never leaves the building. Since it is a central air system  your whole apartment will smell of whatever the other apartments are cooking or smoking. Not one tenant besides me cared about how the place looked. After they got mail they would just through their junk mail on the floor instead of taking it back to their apartments. Along with any other garbage including alcohol bottles  syringes  and cigs. I would be so embarrassed of the place before friends came to visit that I would actually go pick up the junk mail off the floor. I paid $800 a month to basically put up with a terrible apartment.\\nI started to notice roaches everywhere. In previous reviews before the renovation  this was a huge problem. So I went to the front office and they assured me they would come on Tuesday and I approved for that Tuesday. So I took the whole day of work off Tuesday and no one ever showed up. I come back to my apartment one day and what do I find? A notice saying them entered my apartment and sprayed! I did not approve that day and just because they missed the first one does not mean that they can just waltz in without a 24 hour notice! Once again  illegal. So I went and talked to the front office and they made it seem like it was my fault and I argued with the fact of what if I was sleeping or showering and they just entered and their response was \\\"\"\"\"OH THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING PASSED OUT FROM PARTYING THE NIGHT BEFORE\\\"\"\"\"  but whatever it was settled and that was supposed to be the end of it. Come the next week I was actually in the shower when I hear my front door open. LETS KEEP IN MIND THAT I AM AN 19 YEAR OLD GIRL WHO LIVES BY HERSELF. So I begin screaming \\\"\"\"\"please do not enter!!! Please!!!\\\"\"\"\" and they left. Once again I returned to the office where they assured me \\\"\"\"\"oh we're sorry it wont happen again\\\"\"\"\".\\n In the month of June  the AC went out. I was forced to go live back with my parents since the heat was unbearable. There was no thermostat so I bought an indoor thermometer to see exactly how hot it was. Most of the time it read anywhere from 88-92!!! I have photos and videos to document the whole time the AC was out and how poorly it was handled. At first they promised to have it fixed in a matter of days. I called on the day they promised and they just said \\\"\"\"\"I honestly don't know when it will be fixed\\\"\"\"\". So I would call back a few days later. And got the same \\\"\"\"\"I honestly don't know  I honestly don't know\\\"\"\"\". Calling every few days turned to every single day as I was becoming impatient. This went on for a little over 3 weeks. AZ law states that they have 5 days to fix my AC or else I can go live in a hotel and they would have to pay for it or I could have it fixed personally and bill them. Thankfully  I had my parents house to stay at so I decided to not go to those measures. It came to the point where I would call and say \\\"\"\"\"let me guess you HONESTLY DON'T KNOW?\\\"\"\"\" and of course I was right. Finally  end of June I went to check on my apartment and it was finally fixed that very day. I was obviously upset and entirely fed up with the place that they let me end my lease early. So I moved out and the trouble stopped there right? WRONG! \\nSo I passed the security deposit check since I took great care of my place and I waited to receive my check in 3 days. Those days passed and nothing so I decided to give them to the end of the week  still nothing! So I called and once again they entire terrible staff had \\\"\"\"\"no clue\\\"\"\"\" so I was told they would get it settled.So I had to drive all the way over to their office to pick it up. I get there still no check. Of course she goes \\\"\"\"\" uh we sent it out lemme check\\\"\"\"\" as she goes to just move around her mouse and not even check any sort of document  \\\"\"\"\"we'll send it out again I swear!\\\"\"\"\". So more waiting until it reached a month. went back and demanded the check.\"",

I came to this place because I suck at doing my hair  but in the end that's what I had to do. The whole experience was very disappointing  especially since this place is so close to my house.

However  I do notice that there is not much consistency from visit to visit  as far as what the IPA will taste like or what beers will be available. As far as being the most \\\"\"\"\"intensely flavored\\\"\"\"\" beers in the Valley  as claimed by another reviewer  I would have to disagree. This place is nowhere near that right now. That is not to say that they cannot grow into something special  but as of right now  they still need to work on consistency. \\n\\nFood: Burgers. Burgers. More burgers. If you are not in the mood for a burger  you have a few appetizers to pick from. We opted for the fries (claimed to be in the Belgian style  fried in duck fat) and their artichoke dip... Both were not very good... The fries.... Look.... I have been to Belgium multiple times  specifically for beer and food. These fries are not Belgian in any way  shape or form. These fries were overcooked  and they season them with dried rosemary and thyme. Like  a LOT of rosemary and thyme. Who in their right mind would want to eat overcooked fries with dried twigs sprinkled liberally throughout? It was a greasy  overcooked  twiggy mess. Complete bullocks. \\n\\nThe artichoke dip  also bullocks. It came in a disposable cup  and based upon how it was cooked  and the temperature differences throughout the dish  I am pretty sure it was microwaved. It also had a very milky taste  and did not seem like a dip  but rather a collection of a few ill-thought ingredients that were not properly sealed together.  \\n\\nOverall  this menu is just bad  in my opinion. Perhaps I will return eventually and try a burger  but I will certainly not trust the appetizers ever again. The beer is not terrible  but certainly not anything special. If I do return  it will be in like a year  to see if they have made improvements.  I hate to give a local joint a bad review  but I just did not like it here that much.\"",

I'll be honest that the main reason we stopped was the restaurant had outdoor seating in the shade  but I'm glad that we did. \\n\\nThe brunch menu isn't too big but again  it sounds like they just started offering brunch. Approximately 8 entrees  3 salads  5 sides (toast  cinnamon roll). Everything sounded pretty yummy but also pretty typical for a $18-$30 dinner place  if that makes sense. I mean  eggs benedict  of course -- just with their special flair. French toast  crab cakes  etc. -- all moderately high end entrees with a special touch  but nothing on the menu that made me say \\\"\"\"\"wow  I've never heard of that before.\\\"\"\"\" I opted for the \\\"\"\"\"market eggs benedict\\\"\"\"\" (I think that was the name) and was really  really pleased. Delicious english muffins (I could taste the butter)  wilted spinach (but not so much that it made the dish bitter)  a very generous portion of roast pork  two perfectly poached eggs  and creamy hollandaise sauce with a twist. The dish looked beautiful  it tasted great  and it was hearty -- I didn't leave wishing that I'd also ordered a side. \\n\\nMy friends got mixed drinks and I got a honey ace cider -- also very good. They have four ciders  three morning cocktails  and a large wine selection on their brunch menu  which was great. \\n\\nThe service was good. Not amazing  but there wasn't any point where I was looking around for my server and bugged they weren't there. I asked our server what her favorite thing on the menu was and she said since they just started serving it  she hadn't had much  which was a little surprising -- you'd think the restaurant would give them a preview so that they could make recommendations. \\n\\nThe brunch definitely made me want to go back for dinner  but when I looked at the dinner menu  it looks a bit pricey. Brunch was definitely much more reasonable and seems like a good way to get a taste of the menu without breaking the bank. \\n\\nI only stepped inside to use the restroom but the interior is beautiful -- it made me want to come back and have a drink at the bar.\\n\\nOverall  I would definitely recommend the place.\"",

I am not a vegetarian  vegan  or health nut. Therefore since I did not try their steaks  my review will be based on my experience of service and hospitality.\\n\\nMy wife had been here before  and just said it was \\\"\"\"\"so-so\\\"\"\"\". Why did we go here? Because my first choice didn't open for another 45 minutes  we felt Brio was less than medicore  and the other places in Tivoli were sandwiches  crapes  or Gringo Mexican   and not real fare for dinner.\\n\\nWe were greeted by a very nice hostess  who took us upstairs  and wanted to seat us near the kitchen. Since the place was empty  I asked if we could be seated by the window. I was told that was \\\"\"\"\"a table for four\\\"\"\"\". After I showed signs of leaving  she reluctantly seated us here.\\n\\nOur waiter  Jackson  started out okay  until we informed him we did not want any wine  and were not interested in alcoholic beverages. The \\\"\"\"\"air seemed to go out of his tires\\\"\"\"\"  as we were not going to order items that raise the check and the corresponding tip.  After that it seemed like we were \\\"\"\"\"branded\\\"\"\"\" as \\\"\"\"\"undesireables\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nI told the waiter I was craving a large salad. He suggested the Arrugala Salad.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Crab Cake and Trenne Pasta.\\n\\nThe Crab cake was decent. Better than what is served at  The Palm  and far better than what they try to pass off at The Yard House.\\n\\nMy wife's pasta and meat dish  was \\\"\"\"\"a cut above\\\"\"\"\" the Speghetti Factory. Pasta was over cooked  and the accompanying ingridients  an after thought.\\n\\nMy salad was very disappointing. Poor presentation  and very small portion. \\nHad the waiter  Jackson  said  the salads here are meant for appetiziers  I would have ordered something elese. \\n\\nWe also got a nasty stare  when we asked the food server for more bread. \\n\\nThe saving grace  was the manager  Xavier. Very polite and doing his best to please. When I complained the Salad was not a satisfying meal  as the waiter told me it would be  he offered to take it off the check. Since I had consumed it  I said that would not be fair. \\n\\nHe also offered to have the Chef  \\\"\"\"\"send something out\\\"\"\"\"  but by then  the cold feeling we were left with by other staffers who looked at us like  \\\"\"\"\"you're not what we want here\\\"\"\"\"  left us feeling unwelcome. \\n\\nXavier is a good person  and tried to salvage the situation  by giving me his card  and telling me to contact him prior to coming back. I appreciated his thoughtfulness.\\n\\nAgain  in all fairness  this place is noted for its meat  not salads and pasta  and my friend Phillip  who I usually agree with  gives it a good rating. However  I was left with the impression that the staff \\\"\"\"\"judges a book by its cover\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nWe were not dressed in designer clothes  and didn't have that trendy look when we walked in. The staff acted like we did not belong  and that's how we felt.\\n\\nMy wife might go back with her girl friends  but after getting the feeling that the staff  was looking at me with the thought of  \\\"\"\"\"why don't you go back to the Suncoast Buffet where you belong?\\\"\"\"\"  I am done with this place.\"",

We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us.  The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming.\\n\\nBuilt within an old house  The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar.  Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that!  They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road.  The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork  soft lighting  and lined with black & white photos on the dark red walls.  If I had my choice  the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows.  Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love \\\"\"\"\"seeing behind the curtain\\\"\"\"\" and watching the action.  I  on the other hand  find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space.\\n\\nThe menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty.  We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ($6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread.  We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three.  For entrees I had the Portabella stew ($11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ($14) and was also pleased.  Portions were fair sized  enough for dinner for each of us  not really enough to take home for lunch the next day.  Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta.  The greens were good  the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested.  \\n\\nThis is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta & asked for feedback  which we provided.  He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything  of course  so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well  you know we're not shy!).  We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape.  A few minutes later  the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza.  Yum!  Dense chocolate cake  rich and sweet  a perfect end to the meal.\\n\\nI liked the cozy space  it looks like they'll have some fun specials during the week  there were several things that tempted me on the menu  parking was easy  prices were reasonable  service was great... all in all  we look forward to heading back again.\"",

And for years Starbucks had the worst black coffee in the biz. It was burned-tasting  probably over-roasted in some effort to cut the sweetness of the tons of sugar most people want in their coffee confections. So when I'd go to Starbucks and they'd cheerily ask \\\"\"\"\"what can I get started for you?\\\"\"\"\" I'd just say \\\"\"\"\"medium coffee  black\\\"\"\"\" and usually they couldn't understand. Then I got attitude. I got sick of it. I stayed away in droves.\\n\\nBut then they came out with that Pikes Place\\u00a9 branded stuff (everything needs to have a brand. Intellectual capital and all that) and it was ok and they stopped giving me attitude when I'd order it. Maybe Starbucks could be a coffee destination for me once again.\\n\\nSo it was with some delight that my order at the drive-thru speaker was greeted with a pause and soft-voiced incredulity. When I rolled up to the window  $2.50 in hand  I beheld the almost-offended haughty visage of a tattooed coffee artisan  who handed me a cup almost without making eye contact. \\\"\"\"\"Two-eleven\\\"\"\"\" he said  flatly. I handed him the money and said \\\"\"\"\"keep it\\\"\"\"\"  trying to smooth over the poor dear's rankled nerves. But an artist  once offended  can't be assuaged with a mere tuppence. He said nothing and retreated to his lair behind the window  obviously there to ponder the banality of the philistine he had just encountered. \\n\\nAnd I was delighted.

The design is simple  cohesive  friendly & warm. The praise stops there.\\n\\nWe ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil  and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad. \\n\\nOne person joining us had the deconstructed tacos  which she barely touched  as the fish was more like fish jerky  and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the \\\"\"\"\"best turkey sandwich\\\"\"\"\" with someone  and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out  and it quickly fell apart after the first bite. \\n\\nNothing was exceptional. Sort of bummed by the experience  but at least it will be a fun place to grab a beer on a lovely fall evening.\"",

I've jumped around between many salons in the past because I never felt like hairdressers really understood what I wanted. \\n\\nI went to Dre's several weeks ago and I initially felt like I was in the right place. The salon is bright  new and really beautiful. Everyone was so nice (I can't stress this enough) and greeted me as soon as I walked in. \\n\\nWhen I first sat in the chair and showed pictures of what I wanted  I thought me and the hairdresser were on the same page. I wanted brighter  non-foiled highlights in a really ashy tone. We discussed extra face framing highlights as well. My hair was pretty gold and had grown out highlights  so it looked almost like an ombre going in. The color job was quick and I only processed for a very short time (as a person who has had my hair bleached countless time  this should have been a major red flag). \\n\\nOnce she started drying it (after a trim)  I was so puzzled... it looked exactly the same as when I walked in. I thought maybe it was the lighting  or my eyes  because she said it looked so much better than before. Usually when I don't like something I can say it right away  but this time I was simply at a loss for words. The girl was so nice! I'm an idiot for not saying SOMETHING. \\n\\nI was recommended two (expensive) products and was swiftly checked out and on my way  to the tune of $185(!) with tip. By the way  both products are garbage. \\n\\nNot one person noticed I got my hair done. NOT ONE. And the people that did know I was getting my hair done all said \\\"\"\"\"It looks exactly the same\\\"\"\"\"  so I guess it wasn't just me. I still have golden highlights with my ashy (real) roots. Actually  the one (yes  one) new highlight I can see is my brassiest one. It's like the color you get from at-home bleaching...ugh. and of course it's at the front of my head so I have to hide it by being crafty with my part.\\n\\nI will not be returning and am going to a different salon in hopes of getting bright blonde color I've had before...

What does that tell me about your credibility??\\n\\nWhile I respect your advice  you need to realize that it is my phone and my money  so once I decide to get it replaced  all YOU as a person who repairs it need to tell me is whether you are competent enough to get it done in a professionally acceptable manner. You were not doing me any favors by getting it fixed at the agreed price. I was PAYING YOU. And the $10 deal on Yelp is part of the price you advertised. So that was no discount!! Once you agreed to get it fixed  you needed to play by the rules  which you clearly did not!! You put on a wrong screen and most importantly you did not take care of my phone which I entrusted you with.\\n\\nLet me tell you why I'm not accepting your offer to get the case replaced. How would you feel if some guy took your phone  scraped and scratched the casing and then offered to fix it if you were willing to pay for it. You took a perfectly fine phone (except for the hairline crack) and scraped and scratched the heck out out of it. And now you're trying to get more business from me?? You try to put the blame on me saying the phone was useless after the fall. You don't even know what happened to the phone and yet you make seemingly credible remarks. Bringing it once to you was a mistake. Your same incompetent \\\"\"\"\"technician\\\"\"\"\" is still going to fix this phone if I ever return and I'd never let him repair another phone of mine.

You run this place. And yet  not once but TWICE you delivered a product to a customer which was WAY below the standard of a deliverable. If you really took pride in your business  you'd have reviewed your technician's work and got him to do quality work BEFORE a product was delivered to the customer. Both the times  when you handed over the phone to me  you seemed to have barely taken a glance at the condition in which my phone was being returned to me  which as a customer is something that I cannot digest. When you told me  \\\"\"\"\"I don't know  my technician did it\\\"\"\"\"  you lost my trust as a customer. \\n\\nI'm done doing business with you!\"",

So  we stood outside in the 100 degree Las Vegas heat and called for a reservation.  We were asked when we wanted to eat and my wife told them  we are standing outside and are here for lunch.

Not sure what his presence at the restaurant had to do with us eating lunch.  My wife asked  \\\"\"\"\"Can we go inside and order\\\"\"\"\".  Yes  you may.  Sheesh! \\n\\nSo  in we went.

I loved it.\\n\\nThen came the tiramisu. The owner's wife makes it daily from scratch. I've had my share of \\\"\"\"\"good\\\"\"\"\" tiramisu desserts that people raved about  but I could never fathom ever eating a second time. Hers was amazing.

Not one bit was bad and the garlic and Italian chilies are very good with it. We were stabbing each others' hands with forks to get at the garlic.\\n\\nHere's one thing that I found to set them apart from other restaurants.

When I questioned them about the sticker on the door they said they forgot to scratch it off...but still asked for a different form of payment.\\n\\nI wanted to like this restaurant but unfortunately it was the small food portions and lack of detail (and the fact they don't accept Amex) that makes me not want to go back here.

Very Victorian. It harkens back to the supper clubs of the olden days. I half expect to find gentlemen in top hats when I entered the door. Instead I only found a few mid-day drinkers playing video poker.  Being a sports bar  of course there are wide-screens all over the shop  which seem a bit anachronistic given that the place is swathed in late 19th-century red velvet drapery.\\n\\nInterestingly  the owners have placed a few old-fashioned items on the menu  such as baked brie  which are juxtaposed with more modern tasters  such as the deep-fried mashed potato bites. The menu is fairly enticing.  Sadly the food falls short. It feels like everything here is made to sound impressive  but  looks and tastes like it was cooked at Wendy's. I would have assumed it was all fresh-made  but it all tastes to me like it originated in the freezer.\\n\\nToday  I tried the Chicken Florentine Soup. It definitely came from a can.  No doubt about it. Then I got a California Turkey Burger.  The lettuce was limp  the avocado was almost non-existent  and the turkey patty was too salty.  However  there was a nice char on the patty  and I do love grill marks.\\n\\nMy main complaint is that this swanky restaurant has tremendous potential and no one here seems to know how to reach it.  The menu was promising. The descriptions of each item got me salivating.  Unfortunately  my dining experience turned out to be like a bad blind date:  your friend tells you how great this hamburger is  and then you finally meet it... and it is nothing compared to the burger you tasted in your dreams.\\n\\nMy advice to Elixir: if you're going to do gourmet pub food  actually do gourmet pub food.  It's just not right to titillate a person's tongue without bringing the taste buds to climax; wink  wink.",

If they want to compete with other Asian lunch options on or near the square  they need to lower the prices and have a better presentation  on the plate and table AND with the overall look and feel (the disposable chopsticks were the sliver-giving kind). I also sat next to the window in a seat that was backed right up into the wall. It felt a little warm and stuffy in there as well. Overall  I feel the place needs a little more soul.

I would give the food 5 stars. I was expecting it be because the owner is Chef John Chien Lee  former executive chef of Social House at Aria. The service wasn't the best at least for me with the wait staff and I expand on why later on. \\n\\nFirst the food. We ordered baked mussels  seaweed salad  the spicy tuna roll  the salmon and avocado roll  and the salmon wasabi creme (the dish I was excited to try the most). The appetizers tasted the same as they would any other Japanese restaurant nothing special. I love salmon and it was definitely on point in both the wasabi creme and paired with avocado in a roll. The spicy wasabi creme had a nice hint of lemon tangy to compliment the fish  but the wasabi creme could of had a little more punch to it. In the roll  the avocado was nice and creamy and it looked like more of a mash than just a big chunk  which was very appreciated. Mid meal  the Chef and Owner  John Chien Lee  came out to check on everyone dining and when he can by our table he was friendly and welcoming. He saw that I had a thing for salmon and asked if I would mind to try something similar  but not salmon  compliments of the chef and I said sure! He brought us out the house special ocean trout and it was just what he said delicious! I never knew trout could taste as good as salmon and I enjoyed the surprise of the pop rocks that had top it off! \\n\\nThe service would get a rating of 3 stars. It wasn't till the chef talked to us that the waiters had a bit more urgency to serve us  which was just two people. It wasn't too busy when we walked in  but it took longer than usually for them to sit us when there were plenty of tables available and the waiter also forgot we were there after he had told us to wait a moment. I think that the chef probably just got there a few minutes after we had sat because it seemed that every customer after us  they were on it and asking if it was there first time and giving them dishes of the house  which we did not receive. Though the chef made up for it with the complimentary dish of trout! \\n\\nThe ambiance of the place was okay. It was like top 40 with house music playing  similar to places like ra sushi minus the loudness. Decoration was okay  could have been more  but will do. I did enjoy the menu and the way it was set up! \\n\\nAll in all if your looking for fresh fish at a great price with a chef who has experience from working at a well known sushi spot on the strip  without the pricey cost  this is definitely a spot to try! Happy hour runs Mon-Sat. the days they are open from 4p-6pm. And even though the service was ehh  the food was delicious and I'll definitely go back for more.",

Also  the front says 24 Hour Video Poker  which I just found strange. Yes to promoting 24 hours  NO to video poker. Just makes it seem like it's going to be really crappy bar food or something. \\n\\nThe host who sat us seemed like he had no idea how to host. He just seemed lost  but it wasn't a big deal. We got seated very quickly. We were greeted by our server  Jose  who was great. He convinced us to get Margaritas in spirit of Fat Tuesday. He wasn't pushy at all  very friendly and nice. He took our order  and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he won't be our server tonight. Poor Jose was being sent home because it was slow. It was strange as it wasn't super slow in there. It was even stranger that Jose seemed to linger on about this  almost to the point of talking down about the establishment. It was sad  I liked Jose and wanted to give him a tip but I didn't have change and he had to leave. \\n\\nWe were told of the special  which sounded like Chic Parm  except substitute chicken with steak. It sounded awful so we went with Carne Asada and my friend got Shrimp tacos. My carne asada  for the price they charged  was pretty wack. You expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender. It lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada. The rice and the refried beans were good though. Shrimp tacos were all right as well.\\n\\nThen it just took forever to A) get the bill and B) get the server to get the money back to pay the bill. In the meantime I had a random woman (guessing it's the owner) asking me if everything was all right. It was  it was just strange. Who are you? Are you the owner? Random patron? What is going on in this place?!\\n\\nFinally got someone to pick up my check. The total was $19 and some change. I put in a twenty. I get it back and I get no change. I mean we're talking about like 50 cents or so  but really? I didn't get any change back? All right? \\n\\nI'm not mad about the experience  it was just really underwhelming. I love Mexican food. I think this place has just a major image issue. What is it? Is it an authentic Mexican restaurant with Jalisco specific recipes? Or is it like the Mexican version of PTs? Or is it Mexican version of Applebees? Is Jalisco spanish for Applebees?",

A nice salsa bar with several choices  however  the pico de gallo and mild salsa were extremely bland  no salt  tang or heat at all.  The chips were free  but almost chewy instead of crisp.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the ceviche tostada (good) and the pozole (passable)  mine was a little worse.  I ordered the three item combo so I could sample a few things to get a better idea of the food.  The green chile and cheese tamale was flavorless  lots of thick masa with canned green chiles in the middle and no cheese I could find.  The beef taco on a hard shell was unseasoned pot roast on a soggy taco shell  and the cheese enchilada arrived cold with a very thick red sauce.  The refried beans were unpleasantly pasty instead of smooth and creamy and  again  unseasoned and the rice had no flavor or seasoning at all (there seems to be a pattern here with the cooks not seasoning or tasting the food going out)\\n\\nPrice for this was $20 without any drinks (water only) so not terrible price wise  but considering the poor flavor and quality it was not worth it.

Two months ago we took them to their new Scottsdale location. They had just opened and were quite disorganized as they put it. When I went to pick up my 3 dogs I noticed my cockapoo had a different collar on without her license and name tag and a different leash. I told them that. Lori said at that time she couldn't call of the the people to figure it out because there were too many people in with their dogs that day. They said that we should replace all of the items they lost and they would take it off our next grooming. I replaced all of the items. The cost came to $47.00. Whicjh is actually cheaper than the items they lost. They lost a jeweled pink collar. We booked another appointment for December17th. The owner called me today and told me that I needed reciepts for all of the items I bought. I didnt keep the receipts. He never said I needed to. Obviously  they would have noticed that my dog had a new collar  leash  license and name tag when I brought her in to get groomed. Gregg told me that a replaced license is $4.00. I was incorrectly charged $17.00 by the county. I did save that receipt because it goes in my dog file. Greg also told me that he needs the receipts for his accountant and that he called his accountant regarding this matter. I know that is not true! Greg and Lori  I have referred customers to you that will no longer come to your facility. Is it really worth losing three customers over an incident that occured because of your negligence? Do you really not trust a customer who has been loyal to you? You knew at the time you lost the coillar etc. There are many dog groomers who would be happy to groom three dogs. I always given you both a 20 percent tip even though you were the owners. Hopefully  both owners will learn from this mistake. If not  they will continue to lose clients. I obviously was insulted and would never come back or refer them again! I also went to a veternarians office and told them of my experience and pulled the cards I left them to give to their clients. Their office was shocked. You simply do not treat customers that way. I guess people's true colors show.",

We arrived at 1:00 PM on a Tuesday and completely missed the crowds. We were promptly greeted  seated and had out drink orders taken by the enthusiastic waitstaff.

Cost is very reasonable for a Las Vegas show.   If you love music  you will love MO5AiC!!",

Customer service is very important to me and today Haymaker missed the mark.  \\n\\nUpon arriving we were greeted and seated quickly.  We were hoping to order breakfast but was told it was no longer an option because they stopped taking orders for breakfast at 11:30 (though it was 11:25 at the time).  Not a problem  their lunch menu looked great.  We waited for 20 minutes for about first contact with one if the wait staff.  We asked for recommendations when we were greeted by the waitress and  with her recommendation  ordered our food and drinks at the same time.   We then proceeded to wait for over an hour food.  About 50 minutes in  we were told that they were sorry for the wait they were having difficulty in the kitchen transitioning from breakfast to lunch.  We politely thank her and recognized that we understood.  About 65 minutes into our wait  our food arrived.  We ordered a French Dip sandwich and their BLAT (bacon  lettuce  avocado & fried tomato).  The French Dip was great  a little soggy but had a great taste.  The BLAT was very dry and lacked taste.  It was not bad enough to not eat but was not very good.  \\n\\nAt the end of the meal we asked if there was anything they could do for us for the wait.  The waitress stated that she had already asked the manager and she had said no.  We then asked to talk to the manager and she said that she was sorry and she recognized that we had waited a very long time for our meal.  She stated that they were new and it was the computer/transition to breakfast and there was nothing they could do.  After a few more minutes of conversation  she agreed to comp us one meal.  \\n\\nI first recommend the manager reading the book Fred 2.0.  The customer experience is so important and even having to ask for something to be done due to the long wait fails to meet \\\"\"\"\"great customer service\\\"\"\"\".  Being in the service industry myself  I would have comped the meal and given a free return meal so we could prove to the customer how great we normally are.  \\n\\nUnfortunately I will not be returning and will recommend to others to do the same....\"",

He was very nice and very professional and willing to give recommendations. We had the cheesy fries that were delicious. They were topped with fresh cheese and  bacon so we had to eat them quickly so the cheese would stay 'stringy' and the bacon was nice and crispy. Also had an order of wings which were good just wish we would have ordered the hot or the pineapple habanero I think was the other hot flavor. Other than them not having any spice they were cooked perfectly crispy and no oil dripping like some places. Next time we will order the hot ones! I order the 2 angus slider and they were pretty simple but tasty. Some sort of sauce that is not overpowering  grilled onions and the meat in a nicely toasted buttered bun. I order the house margarita to go along with it and it was delicious. Served in a cute mason jar and was pretty strong for being on happy hour special. The husband got the pastrami sandwich and he loved it. I snuck a taste and I'm not a fan of mustard but other than that it was really good and good size portions. Some things are a little pricey but the overall quality of everything was great  super fresh and they have happy hour EVERYDAY which is usually unheard of on the weekends which is very nice.

If that really bothers you I'm not sure I'd recommend this place. We sat outside in the garden area but maybe they don't have birds up on the roof or inside. The pizza and salad were good and the service was great. I'm not a fan of sweet salad dressing but the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette was surprisingly not bad. I found a white wine I liked and hubby found a good beer (he's very particular). They will be brewing their own beer here soon. Loved the atmosphere. It was great for a temperate early evening in March but we'll have to see what it's like about the middle of July!",

The first thing I did when I walked in was order a drink.  Stella Atrois $6.15 per draft.  Its a bit expensive  but being downtown and directly across from the Console Energy Center  I expected drinks to be a little on the expensive side.  \\n\\nAfter I was seated with my party  we were served bottles of water at the table.  I suspect tap water in reusable glass bottles.  After  it took quite a bit for our waitress to come back to take our order. My girlfriend and I started with the Poutine Appetizer.  Again  it took a long time for our food to arrive.  The app was pretty good  but for french fries  cheese and gravy  $10 was a bit on the expensive side.  But again  downtown restaurant so it was expected.  My girlfriend also ordered a glass of white wine.  It was served in a soaking wet glass.  And when she commented on that to the waitress and asked for a different glass  the waitress almost seemed annoyed. \\n\\nFor dinner  I ordered the Hangover Cure Sandwich with blue cheese  garlic fries.  My girlfriend had the crab cake entree.  It took almost 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  There were two crab cakes about the size of a hockey puck each  (no pun intended) and the cost was $27.  This time  I expected a little but more in the portion department for $27.  When my entree arrived  everything looked great but the waitress forgot my side of ranch dressing.  She then looked at me and said \\\"\"\"\"oh  I forgot your ranch dressing  Ill be right back with that\\\"\"\"\".  Needless to say  she never brought it.  It also took forever for her to bring our check  pick them up  and return them.  It almost made my friends late for the concert.  At this point  the restaurant was dead  so being busy had nothing to do with the time it took our waitress to do her job.\\n\\nAll in all  I would not suggest this place.  There are a lot of other restaurants downtown (and just across the river on the south side) that are a lot better bang for your buck and a lot better service.  I will not be going back.\"",

Unfortunately I'm still waiting for one. \\n\\nBefore coming here I did my research and know the difference between full and signature versions. Yet I'm still giving it a poor review  after 3 trips here now. \\n\\nTrip 1 - Monday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins. Waited for food for 10 mins  which was good because it took 5 mins of waiting for a table to sit at. BBQ burger was ok.\\n\\nTrip 2 - Thursday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins again. Waited another 25 mins for food!   Took 10 mins this time to get a table. They forgot to put the lettuce on the burger. Was good tasting but not great. Got to sit and listen to guy arguing with manager.  He said the cheese in his burger was still frozen. She said they don't heat it up and he said he understood that but this was actually frozen  not cold. She offered to make him another one but he didn't hVe time since the wait had used up his lunch break. She didn't offer him a refund but instead took his name so next time he comes in they can give him something. Not good customer service. \\n\\nTrip 3 - Sunday lunch. Line wait was 5 mins. Pretty quick. Choice of tables since restaurant was less than half full. Shake wait was 2 mins  and food wait was another 5 mins. Definitely faster.  Food was a little worse than previous trips. BBQ burger was smothered in sauce with very little onion strings so it was hard to eat. \\n\\nOverall\\nNot pleasant experiences. \\nMusic is constantly too loud. People next to us were complaining as well since you have to practically yell to talk to each other. \\nWait times during normal lunch times is way too long. I've never waited that long at a full steak and shake and it should be much faster here. \\nSingle size drink sucks. Give us multiple sizes to choose from. \\nGarbage can opening are barely large enough for the tray to fit in to let alone flip them to empty the garbage. \\nSeating area wayyyyyy to small. \\nFood is definitely not the quality of a true steak and shake.

I like to drop in on Denny's for their build-your-own-burger with the veggie patty since I can make a vegan burger from there.\\n\\nMy order was quite simple and I think there were only maybe five other tables  at most  in the entire restaurant.  Two servers were on the floor and of course the kitchen staff.  Here's where the breakdown happened.  \\n\\nWhat I ordered: water  veggie burger with lettuce  tomato and saut\\u00e9ed onions on a whole wheat bun.  \\n\\nWhat I got: veggie burger with lettuce  tomato and saut\\u00e9ed onions on a SESAME SEED BUN.  No water.  Just food with the wrong bun. \\n\\nI understand mistakes happen however  water should be the first thing to hit the table.  When the server brought the food  she realized  apologized and slowly got the water.  Make no mistake  everyone I encountered on staff was extremely nice.  When you're thirsty  nice doesn't matter much.  My glass got to less than half and still had some food left but never had an opportunity to get a refill since no one came around for long periods of time to check on me.  I had one walking-past check in: \\\"\"\"\"you alright?\\\"\"\"\" and that was it.  I was ok at that point but at least one more stop by later I would have gotten a refill on water.\\n\\nI didn't have to wait long for the check  that seemed to appear quite quickly.  Anyway  I may decide to come back here just to get my guilty pleasure on but I'm bringing my own water this time  thank you very little.\"",

The chef  waitress & manager were all French which I thought was a good sign.  I was expecting the same quality but unfortunately I was wrong.  The managers and waitress were all very polite and well mannered.  It is unfortunate that the food quality was just mediocre and average.  I mistakenly chose a 3 course set meal for dinner as opposed to lunch but the manager was very kind and talked to the kitchen staff and they were willing to prepare the dinner set for me.  I am unsure if the limited time to get ready the dinner food before dinner actually affected the quality of the food.  If that was the case then they should have said no to me ordering the dinner during lunch.  I had Baked scallops served \\u00e0 la Proven\\u00e7ale as the starter.  The scallops were fresh and delicately prepared but the roasted peppers that came with it tasted like they were from the jars.  I had Duck legs with ratatouille  roast garlic and tapenade sauce as the main.  The duck was a bit tough for a leg dark meat and seems like they were deep fried from as opposed to properly prepared French style.  The worst was actually the desert.  The Creme Brulee tasted like a thick custard and not a proper Creme Brulee.  I judge French food by their Creme Brulee but this not Creme Brulee so it felt like I actually have nothing French to judge in this restaurant.  I have been to France for food and yes  the chef is French but quality is really not up to French scratch.  A bit of a let down.  The only pro is that the waitress & manager were very nice to me.  But I eat in a restaurant for the food  not really the service.  Once is enough I think.",

My husband and I have gotten this deal numerous times in the past so  with it being 4:15 pm  thought I'd stop on my way home and get a couple limeades. I pull in the drive-thru  place my order  and when the amount totaled the drinks at REGULAR price  I asked the employee at the window \\\"\"\"\"Shouldn't the drinks be half off?\\\"\"\"\" She gave me a blank stare and replied \\\"\"\"\"no\\\"\"\"\". I then asked her if its happy hour  and she replied \\\"\"\"\"We stopped doing that\\\"\"\"\". Surprised by this and knowing they were advertising 1/2 price drinks for 2:00-5:00 happy hour  I asked her to double-check. She came back a few moments later \\\"\"\"\"Happy hour only goes til 4:00\\\"\"\"\". Disgusted with the service  lack of apology  and her lying to me about discontinuing happy hour  I said I changed my mind about the drinks. Thinking I was going crazy for just seeing the Happy Hour advertised from 2:00-5:00 pm  I double-checked the board by the drive-thru. Sure enough  Happy Hour was clearly stated from 2:00-5:00  and I was right about my drinks being rung up wrong. And also  what happened to the customer always being right? I think the Happy Hour specials are something employees should know. I love this place's limeades but their service has been horrendous every time I have visited. They really need to hire better help.\"",

They transformed the streets where the festival took place with wall murals; one side of a building was 3D and the next building someone had scraped away the paint to create one of the most amazing pieces of work I have had the pleasure to see. They converted an old run down motel into an art exhibit - walking from room to room to experience a new artist. I was even able to witness two artists paint and transform the side of a building during one of the shows. I did not attend the culinary village or those events - let's face it  I was there for the music.\\n\\nThe overall festival was so organized. There was never a time where I felt lost or that there wasn't whatever I needed (bathrooms  beer  food  water  ferris wheels  maps  etc.) within 20 feet of me. Having been to many festivals  that really was amazing to me especially being with this being LIB's first rodeo. Even the people that attended this festival were so magnificent - I met so many wonderful people. During the concerts  there wasn't any pushing or shoving or a single time where I felt submerged in chaos. The crowds and all of the bands/musicians that played at this festival solidified my heart. \\n\\nYes  things were overpriced. For instance  a beer at the tents was $9... for a heineken? Oh please. Luckily if you took a little walk into the old shops  they converted the barber shop into... what you say.. A BAR! Cocktails - $3  Cans of beer - $4. They also had food around here  but I chose to eat away my life in plantains and Arepas outside of the festival at a nearby Venezuelan joint. \\n\\nWhat I do know from this short story is  I WILL BE BACK LIB!!",

        "text": "\"Ruben and I were really excited when we first heard about the festival brewing and made sure to purchase wristbands on the first day it went on sale (06/07/13). Early bird prices were gone within seconds. I have a feeling there were just a couple available. Either way  we still scored the second lowest price of $119 for two-day access wristbands. Payment was due immediately and wristbands arrived mid-October  within a couple weeks of the festival. \\n\\nBoth days started at 10 a.m. and ended at midnight. A few blocks of Downtown Las Vegas were sectioned off for the big event with El Cortez Hotel & Casino and East Fremont in the midst. All-day parking and shuttles were available from select Strip hotels (Caesars Palace  Planet Hollywood  Bally's) and World Market Center on Grand Central Parkway  for $40 (for the weekend). Although the list of things you couldn't bring to the festival (NO umbrellas  lounge chairs  coolers) was much longer than the list of things you could bring  we were extremely grateful that they allowed two (2) factory-sealed one-liter water bottles per attendee. \\n\\nWe were fortunate to have a ride to and from the festival grounds on both days. It still sucked. It was just such a nuisance for all parties involved. There will be a better way next year (without spending an additional $40). We prepared for our long days with a backpack and small crossbody purse filled with four Smart Water liter bottles for each day (need those electrolytes!)  snacks  small towels  blanket  chapstick  cash  and sunscreen lotion (non-aerosol). It all paid off  so I highly recommend these items! Dress comfortably too since it was pretty warm during the day and bring a jacket for the evenings.\\n\\nMusic: We loved it. Ruben is a really big fan of alternative music  so he was pretty stoked about the line-up. It helped that we planned and mapped out our attack since there was so much going on at the same time. Plus  the stages were not close to each other; good for the experience  bad for the legs/feet. We were able to catch most or all of Youngblood Hawke  Capital Cities  Imagine Dragons  Childish Gambino  Janelle Monae  Passion Pit  Vampire Weekend  and The Killers. Some acts overlapped others  so we had to rush from one stage to the next  but the last three acts of the second day were back-to-back at the same stage  so we were lucky and had amazing spots near the stage! The bands were all great  but some stood out more than others. Youngblood Hawke were much better than I expected  Imagine Dragons and Vampire Weekend had rad performances (loved the Cirque du Soleil collaboration with ID) and The Killers were really freakin' awesome!\\n\\nThe various attractions were also fun: signing the gigantic inaugural festival banner  decorating bricks for The Wall  shooting a paintball gun at cardboard designs (bonus  free shirt!)  various heart sculptures  the amazing murals and other art pieces on various buildings  the \\\"\"\"\"Art of Beer\\\"\"\"\" Garden where local artists  Giovanni Morales and LeslieAnn Farrell were live painting  the Learning Stage with notable speakers like Las Vegas' own Tony Shieh  and the Culinary Village that featured famous chefs and local eateries (Nobu  Payard  Fleur  DOCG Enoteca  Honey Salt).\\n\\nWe didn't end up eating anything (except nameless tent garlic fries) since the offerings weren't extremely exciting and I figured if I really wanted to eat something  I could go to their respective restaurants. So  we ate before and after the festival and enjoyed a couple beverages (fresh fruit smoothies and beer  mmm). Oh  and random  but the port-a-potties were great! Most were placed under tents  placed in several areas of the festival grounds  well-kept  and I appreciated the portable sinks very much (complete with soap and paper towels!). Overall  a fun and memorable event. I haven't been to any other large festivals  so I don't really have any comparison. This is also coming from someone that doesn't really enjoy all-day outdoor engagements (I have the same feelings toward amusement parks). It's exhausting. After two days of standing  walking  and really crowded spaces  I was very tired. The most important thing is  would I go again next year? The answer is yes.\"",

        "text": "\"Second year should have been sufficient to rid themselves of all the inaugural kinks. Downgrade incoming ....\\n\\nTo be clear: there will always be some issues  this is natural; although  the main problem at Life Is Beautiful Music & Arts Festival is that they don't seem to be insomuch as trying in some areas. They are advertising in mass to the masses  and most people go to just one concert a year  so this would be the time of their lives no matter how mediocre it was put on. \\n\\nFirst  my biggest gripe from the initial review in 2013 was the lineup. Boy was it shitty! Of course this is somewhat subjective  although my three-pronged test of (a) unique bookings; (b) once in a lifetime collaborations; and  (c) memorably factor among the haze of all other events was certainly not met. \\n\\nYear two included two hip hop nights (headliners) and one seldom-to-perform subheadliner  (Lionel Ritchie); the third and best headliner was the soon-to-be-inducted Foo Fighters. All in all great: this year saw an expansion in the length of the festival as well as the festival grounds. (And police roaming around.)(Is the latter just a natural \\\"\"\"\"improvement \\\"\"\"\" or related to the genre headlining two of the nights? Only the decision-makers can say.)\\n\\nSo why the downgrade of a star if the headliners are superior and that was complaint number one from the inaugural year? \\n\\nWell ...\\n\\nSpeaker lectures\\nYou book Pussy Riot in an absurdly small capacity venue? Are you serious? You are lucky that their followers are peace-loving; had it been Rage Against The Machine ....\\n\\nWater points\\nWhere in the bloody fuck are they? They appeared to be significantly increased (perhaps three times more than 2013?)  but it still not enough. Bottled water was decreased to 3$  but that is still 50% more than Coachella's 2$ bottles. \\n\\nFerris wheel \\nNo single riders is a preposterously offensive policy. I heard of this from someone who was simply attempting to finish the application bingo card thing. The signs say 5$ per person. \\n\\nArt\\nWhat was great the first year changed into a somewhat mediocre affair in the second. Gone are the festival-goer driven installations like the heart that is now in front of Container Mall  and the wall of bricks who seemingly are kept in storage throughout the year. This year you could draw or sign a banner again  and draw on a balloon. (Pesky balloons that would block the view of the stage for those behind them. Genius.)\\n\\nFood\\nIt looked good. I did not partake in buying any this year so it will not factor in my review. Go to others for that: I am here for the music. \\n\\nMusic\\nBest of 2014: Matt & Kim (Western stage)\\nBest of 2013: Smith Westerns (Red Bull\\u00ae bus)\\n\\nAfter Coachella installs a V.I.P. area -- which is ridiculously unfavoured by the general festival-goer -- LiB turns around and adds one to the Downtown (main) and Ambassador (outdoor) stages? Seriously? Take a wild guess as to who was in the V.I.P. area at Coachella earlier this spring apparently. \\n\\nInstead of attending festivals and borrowing from their absolute most shittiest idea  Rehan should attend Bonnaroo and learn how they run the comedy tent (so the same system can be applied to the lectures). At least borrow good things from other festivals. \\n\\nIf this paradigm continues -- by year three -- it will be a one-star for Life is Beautiful. And  year four won't even happen (as they are profusely bleeding red ink). Go to it while you still can.\"",

Please refer to my photo  notice that the mayo isn't baked at all. When the order first came out I thought it was a slice of cheese on muscle  and the muscles were cold.

Yeah  totally what they served us. The salmon was slimy and not fresh at all. The rice to fish ratio was more rice than fish. Honestly when a sushi restaurant starts cutting corners to gain more profit  their food sucks.\\n\\nNigiri Yellow Tail Sushi:\\nAlso slime layer  more rice to fish ratio. Wasn't happy.\\n\\nNot so hot Tea:\\nNot sure how the hell you mess up hot tea. Okay I understand you don't want to burn customers but warm closer to cold tea isn't considered hot tea. \\n\\nService:\\nNot so great  our tea was never hot.

She spoke to us just enough to make us feel more than welcome without interrupting our business dinner.  \\nThe other bartender. Well  all I will say is he was not as interested in being there and seem liked he was having a bad night and wanted out ASAP.

They have a great signature list as well.  Here is the issue. The pricing was beyond sky high! It was as  if not more expensive than Manhattan.  Actually it was like Dubai not Pittsburgh.  \\nEXAMPLE: The Woodford Reserve Sonoma Cutrer Bourbon which is one of my favorites that Chris Morris of Woodford makes.  It's something I look for and generally ( from low end to high) around $18-$35. This is across the country  from LA to Denver to Houston and Boston.  I travel a lot for business and I can stand firm on this pricing model.  Well  here it was $90 for a two ounce pour. OUCH!! And most of the cool whiskeys like this were outrageous. I won't dwell on the negative pricing anymore.  \\n\\nIN CLOSING: I certainly don't want this to be a negative at all because I loved the place and will definitely visit again when I'm back in PBGH.  However their booze pricing needs to be examined. It was the difference between a 5 star review and 4 starts for me.

It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. \\n\\nI am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasons:\\n\\n1) Every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off. The fan runs 24/7 and flashes a green light. While some may not find it to be a big disturbance  I personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs. Broadstone Alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue Leed certification. (Leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations). The manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air  you can be the judge. \\n\\n2) You can hear noise in hallways vividly. While noise insulation between units appears decent  because there is a slit under unit doors  if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours  it is audible. \\n \\n3) Apartments monthly rent can be for example $1299 for a studio  $1500+ for a 1bdrm and you must have renter's insurance. (keep in mind the area  this is not NYC)\\n\\n4) If you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing. Apply that to the sample apartment rents.  $2600 and $3000+. I was not offered any negation room to break the lease.  \\n\\nIt is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price. At such high prices I would expect the corporation to have enough decency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of it's occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease breaks.",

I figured he was going to set me up and supervise the first few rounds to see if I knew what I was doing...which he did.\\n\\nAfter emptying the clip I asked him where the extra rounds were.  He said that was all of them (4 remaining of 20).  I said  oh OK I guess I would need to purchase a full box of ammo to continue shooting.  He said I would be required to buy another complete \\\"\"\"\"package\\\"\"\"\" which was $25 for a gun and 20 extra rounds.  I shook my head in disbelief.  I assumed I could shoot all day as long as I was buying thier ammo  renting the lane  buying thier targets and renting thier guns.  That was not the case.  When I was done shooting in all of 2 minutes I told him what bulls#@! I thought that was and how screwed I felt..\\n\\nI and not a regular range shooter so I just sucked it up and figured next time I went anywhere I would have to ask if they were like any real range or do they screw you $25 at a time like the Vegas Machine Gun Experience.\"",

        "text": "\"This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday  and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.\\n\\nWhen we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok  sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA  which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out  so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels  but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread  and the waitress asked if I wanted the \\\"\"\"\"bread basket\\\"\"\"\"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins  I believe blueberry and raspberry  a dinner roll  and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.  \\n\\nOnto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast  that came with Jasmine Rice  a ginger root puree  with baby bok choy  and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger  just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck  though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101  render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy  but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  \\\"\"\"\"What's wrong?\\\"\"\"\"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden  stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.\\n\\nSo we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10 000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show  my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10 000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread  as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday  spend a decent amount of dough  only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate  accommodating  and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't.\"",

Hip  warm  and comfortable with a lot of smiling faces...not something usually seen down here in Florida. Second?  The breakfast bagel was freaking amazing. I see that has been said a few times. It's true. They don't screw around with the ingredients  instead letting them speak for themselves. Ham edges crispy. Big fluffy layers of whipped eggs. Excellent quality cheese.

We are visiting my parents and they were very excited to try this \\\"\"\"\"new\\\"\"\"\" restaurant that had recently been reviewed in the paper.  How sorry they are.\\n\\nOur party of 7 called at 6:30pm and asked about arriving at 7pm for a party of seven.  \\\"\"\"\"No problem\\\"\"\"\" and \\\"\"\"\"what's your name?\\\"\"\"\" was the response and off we went.  We arrived and the greeter/hostesses were rude and said they didn't show a reservation for us.  We pointed it out and they said they couldn't honor/accommodate us.  As they saw our jaw drops  they akwardly walked off and tried to piece something together.  They offered us a table in the bar OR said we could wait 20 minutes for a table in the main dining room.  Having 3 kids with us  we elected for the bar.  We were seated at about 7:05 and then  after having our orders for drinks/food taken at 7:25  we still didn't receive anything (drinks or chips) until 7:45.  The drinks were wrong.  My 6-year old daughter ordered lemonade and was told they had it;  they didn't and brought her a Sprite.  She said she had ordered lemonade and they said they didn't hear her. They said they had \\\"\"\"\"homemade\\\"\"\"\" limeade so she agreed.  When it arrived at 8:00  she tasted it and told us it tasted weird.  My husband tried it and said it was margarita mix.  Seriously?   After numerous drink mix-ups and having servers come and verify and re-verify certain food orders  they brought our food out at 8:15.  Things were looking up!  \\n\\nThe food:  2 of us got the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were good.  One of us got the carnitas and he said it was just \\\"\"\"\"ok.\\\"\"\"\"  The rice tasted awful but the beans were decent.  The food was all pretty cold (definitely the kitchen had not timed the food prep/service well) but we were done complaining.  It was up to them and they seemed to know we were not happy as the owner continued to avoid us like the plague despite her servers telling her how badly things were going at our table.  Chips were good  hot sauce was watered down and almost tasteless.\\n\\nThe check:  Upon the conclusion of our meal  the check was delivered.  There was an add'l drink on there (the extra Sprite from the earlier mix up) and upon us asking  they responded but we brought you the limeade.  Well  that was on there too!  Also  the mandatory gratuity was included b/c we were a party of 7.  Are you kidding me?  The owner is there  never comes over to apologize and then they charge us for everything and include gratuity?  I spoke with the server  told her that despite her best efforts  it was a misreable experience and that we were very disappointed having driven 30 minutes.  She apologized and said she had spoken to the owner and told her but that she didn't care.  Seriously?  \\n\\nI will NEVER waste my time here again and am flabbergasted that this place is still in business after 8 weeks.  It will not last given it's current state.  They were clearly understaffed and yet the owner continued to seat large parties despite the obvious breakdown in all aspects. \\n\\nDo not waste your time going to this location.  This place needs a manager and obviously NOT the owner running the place.  She was rude (I saw her get into it with 2 other customers) and I saw 2 tables leave.  She obviously doesn't care about what the customers think and she avoided our table going so far as to hide in the kitchen until we left.   Shameful and awful.  This review would not have been written had she come out  apologized for the lack of service and bought us a round of drinks just to show that she was committed to making a bad situation better.\"",

I got in line and the line was long and getting longer. There were 2 cashiers one of them had a very large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on. All of a sudden  one of the cashiers  who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui  stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION. She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer  but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter. She has a promising future at the DMV. After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she wasn't supposed to start that until 2:45 (it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes) and that it shouldn't take her more than 5 minutes. Clearly she hasn't seen her in action. Or inaction. The girl acted like this was new information (I doubt it) and went ahead and started ringing. I swear there was steam coming off the entire line. It was totally ridiculous. I will absolutely never shop here again.",

Not sure if that's good or bad  depending on your preference but I do tend to feel a little less guilty eating this. It appears it's been lightly seasoned vs the other which seems covered in butter and seasonings-but who knows the real ingredients at each place. \\n\\nWhat bothered me was the worker. She was nice as can be letting me try whatever I wanted and was giving me her opinion on flavors  which was appreciated.  Whenever I tried one flavor  she stuck her hand inside the bucket bare hands and all  no gloves  no scooper and grabbed a few pieces and ate it while I ate my sample and when I asked her questions she had food in her mouth  I almost felt like I had to wait for her to finish chewing and swallowing before asking for another sample. She must have done this with 5 plus different flavors. Mind you  when I first walked in she did not wash her hands (like how they do at Subway or Golden Spoon  you actually see the employee wash their hands in front of you). I saw the sink  but no hand wash. I wouldn't mind the no hand wash if she had gloves  but to stick her bare hands in the tub of popcorn and munch on popcorn seemed inappropriate and unsanitary. \\n\\nIf you like Dole Whip  theirs tastes like the real thing but the amount you get for $2.50 is about 5 bites maybe 6?

There's a huge smorgasbord of options to choose from on the brekkie menu  and the hardest part is actually picking something to order because they all sound so good!\\n\\nI couldn't resist ordering the eggs benedicto. What a cute twist on your typical eggs benedict dish! The eggs were perfectly poached on toasty slabs of english muffin and accented with the rich and savory sundried tomato hollandaise. The bits of candied prosciutto added a nice meatiness to the benedict without making it too heavy. And while I don't normally reach for mixed greens for breakfast.... I did like it in this dish because my usual gripe with eggs benedict is that there's just wayyy too much going on. But the greens were a light alternative that kinda balanced everything out in a way that potatoes don't do it for me.\\n\\nI also picked up the horchata latte. I'm a huge fan of horchata (which is pretty hard to find in Hawaii where I'm from) and a coffee lover  so this was a must try for me! It's totally sweet  creamy  and probably chock full of calories  but worth every single tasty sip. \\n\\nIf you're not feeling in a benedicto mood  that's OK because there's a ton of other food options to choose from. All of which resemble your standard breakfast fare  with a little bit of a twist. Mexican  southern  classic american breakfasts... You name it. If I had more stomach room and a little more time in Madison  I'd wanna try a little bit of every dish on the menu. One of each  please!",

The first time my fianc\\u00e9 and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes  which I've had many times  without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep  you guessed it  pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing  hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fianc\\u00e9 was done with his meal. I start eating them  and they are pretty darn good  then I just decide to flip my pancake over and what do I see?!?! Another freaking nut on the bottom of the freaking pancake!!! Are you kidding me?! At this point I'm almost in tears. This is my life  like it's kind of serious. The waiter kind of laughed and took them away again. I'm sorry  is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah. I wasn't just some disgruntled customer who didn't like something. This should have been taken a lot more serious than it was. Needless to say I will never set foot In this building again.

So  we had high hopes for the new one on Eastern.\\n\\nThe d\\u00e9cor looks fantastic  they basically gutted the whole space and it's very modern looking.  Comfortable seating and lots of it.  Quite an upgrade from the previous tenant.  We had dinner around 7:15 on a Tuesday and it was about 3/4 full.  We were seated immediately and a server greeted us within 3 minutes.  Our drinks came out very quickly.  So far so good.......\\n\\nAfter this  the wheels kind of fell off.  My wife ordered a half pound of the steamed shrimp with garlic butter.  I decided I didn't want to get super messy  so I got fried shrimp with French fries.  I've had Hot N Juicy's fried shrimp before and loved it  so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.  Well  after about 7 minutes my wife's shrimp was at the table.  I then waited............and waited.  My wife was put in the position of eating her shrimp alone or waiting until my food arrived and then eating a cold dinner.  During this period  while we waited  the waitress basically ignored us.  I think she could tell how angry I was.  25 minutes after my wife's food arrived  I spoke with a supervisor.  She was nice about it  apologized that they were short staffed.  The fries then came out after about 30 minutes.  My shrimp didn't come out until nearly 35 minutes after my wife's food arrived.  This was approximately 40-45 minutes after I ordered.  So  that kind of turned us off to the whole meal.  It may be that my opinion was colored by the experience  but I also thought the food wasn't as good as the Spring Mountain locations.  The breading on the fried shrimp was thicker than last time I had it.  The Cajun fries were good however.  \\n\\nThey handled it well  we were only charged for the steamed shrimp in the bag.  The supervisor and our server were apologetic  but like I said  the meal was pretty much ruined.  I think we'll probably give this location another shot  but so far they seem to be having some issues.",

I ordered a gyro ($4.50 alone or $5.00 for the combo) and wings  ($7.95).  The total came to $15.95 so I stopped the guy and mentioned this. He said the 2 sides of blue cheese was 1 dollar a piece!  I was flabbergasted.  I mentioned that NO WHERE have I ever been would they charge you 1 dollar a piece!  And they were small sides (1 heaping t-spoon).  I would pay 75 cents for a side at Genos's in Tempe for 3 times that amount of BC (needed for big orders).  Get this though  the guy will charge you 50 cents for substituting blue cheese for the regular side of ranch - because it cost more.  Seriously  10 cc's of blue cheese is something that is too much to include with meal as every other plae that I have ever been to will?  Needless to say I cancelled my order.   I wonder  was it really worth it for him to lose that business  AND future business?  \\n\\nAs I was driving home  I thought about the 50 cents increase for the special.  I chose a can of coke instead of the fries.  But here's the math:  By his logic  the two small sides of blue cheese cost more than 4 cans of coke or 4 orders of fries (0.50 X 4  = the $2.00 for the sides of BC).  Crazy.\\n\\nI may go back for the gryo because it's on my way to school and back  and just around the corner  and it wasn't bad.  In a pinch will hit the spot  but it won't be regularly I can tell you that.  He could have had a customer a couple times a week and one that bought more than just a gryo being that I love wings and pizza as well.  Not just that  buy my roommate and I tend to eat out at the same place.  The guy definitely needs better business sense and customer service appreciation.\\n\\n3 stars for the gryo\\n1 star for the blue cheese charge",

Fully expect to get blocked in which happened to me when someone decided to park directly behind me while I was parked in an actual designated parking spot. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very small with maximum occupancy of 14. They have two four person tables and two bar tables that seat two each. The decor is a fusion of very elegant and laid back.

This is a very filling option and I'd strongly suggest on going with the half order option. 5/5\\nKnights in White Satin - I enjoyed this option as well  it is linguine pasta in white whine sauce  lemon juice  heavy cream and white truffle oil with mushrooms and shrimp.  I found the sauce to be a bit watery  but the overall flavor was solid. I am not sure if they skimped on the shrimp or my husband ate it all before we made our plate switch (I suspect the latter) so I can't really comment on the quantity and quality of the shrimp. The half order of this is slightly more expensive than the rest due to more expensive ingredients I'd imagine. 3.5/5\\n\\nThe staff is super friendly and accommodating. It was also very refreshing seeing them lug in locally purchased food products and ingredients when the owner came by with a car full of stuff. No Sysco trucks in sight for this little gem. \\n\\nThey also offer beer  solid salad options  and dessert.

They told me that since it is a discontinued dress there was no way possible that I'd EVER find a picture of it online because the manufacturer pulls the pictures when they discontinue a model.  I let them know I understood that but that in the vast world wide web that I was certain there would be a picture of it SOMEWHERE even though it is no longer for sale by the manufacturer.

When I told them what my budget was and asked if there was more they could do for me on that price since it was outside my budget once I did alterations they were willing to contact the owner and get a better deal by throwing in some alterations.  They have great dresses so if you can get a good deal it might be worth the lack of information they are willing to provide.",

I called today around 3 p.m.  and placed a take-out order for  the lentil fatoush salad  which I've had many  many times at other locations and always thoroughly enjoyed.    Upon arriving   I was a bit \\nsurprised to see how small the restaurant  actually is  based upon the size of their Shea and Tatum locations - I'm sure it has to be difficult getting a table during typical lunch and dinner times.   Also guessing that parking might be an issue; the area right outside the restaurant is not very large.  Obviously the Safeway shopping center has other parking areas to handle the overflow but it could potentially be a hike - not ideal when it gets hot.  Anyways  long story short  my salad was waiting for me  I paid  and brought it home.  Opened it up and discovered they forgot to put in the salad dressing.     Ate it without  consoling myself how many fewer calories I was consuming without the dressing  but it was pretty disappointing - the dressing is a huge component of the salad.  Also disappointing were the onions in it - the carmelized ones were burnt  and the raw chopped red was overwhelmingly  strong.    Even the cucumbers had an odd taste to them.   I think I'll continue to visit the Shea location until this one has been up and running a bit longer - they seem to have some kinks to iron out.",

Since it is a new place  the staff should be a little more inviting. When you walk in the door for the first time  it's hard to tell if you are to seat yourself and a server comes over or if you are to get in line (and which side of the counter because there were people on both sides and cutting in front of people in the other line). The three times I went there were no greetings or acknowledgement from the staff-even if they saw us come in. I thought that was a little rude. Not a good first  second or third impression for a business that just opened in a community.\\n\\nI will have to try the food sometime when they have had a chance to get their staff trained on common courtesy and customer service. \\n\\nI always hate it when I either go to a place and love the food  but the experience was bad or if I hate the food  but the staff  experience and decor is cool.",

Although  I did stop one of the wandering hosts and he told me some things about the way sls is being ran  he led me into a tornado. First he led me to player card services ( I think ) to where the guy sitting at the desk asked for my ID. He walked off with it and not until I realized I was sitting for a long time and got up to find him  he was standing in the room behind me talking with another employee. Obviously not the kind of 'great service I want to give another try.' Even worse is that when he noticed me looking for him  he directed me to the high limit card services. They were even more clueless then he was. The pretty girl working the high limit has to call a supervisor to... Make a card??? And even THE MANAGER didn't know and took her several tries to produce one. Believe me  I know all about opening new establishments. I opened the Hilton in San Diego as a chef. Same kind of thing. Working there I was really let down because I thought a big name like Hilton (sunstone/Blackstone) would be organized.

Unless  they completely change the entrance and layout??? Hate to break it to you but whomever redesigned the construction should be fired.

After waiting almost a half hour and no keys arrived  we went back down to the lobby with our luggage and waited at the front desk   Naturally  the shift changed at midnight and all new personal where manning the front desk.  After re-explaining our situation  they finally gave us keys to the new room  apologized to us and promised that we would be contacted the next day from \\\"\"\"\"Guest Services\\\"\"\"\" in order to switch to a king room. Since we are Silver Hilton Honors members  I assumed that at least a phone call with an apology or an offer to switch rooms would come; the day came and left and nobody ever contacted us.  We slept in separate beds for our 20th anniversary trip.  It appears that the SLS staff couldn't care less for their guests.\"",

The room is tiny  the ceiling is unfinished and the windows had mini blinds  bathroom was so weird having the sink in the outside of the room. You can't  even wash your hands immediately after using the toilet  instead you have to slide the door first. How unsanitary is that? \\n\\nThen as we get into the bed the bed was missing fitted sheets. I called front desk they sent housekeeping to give us the sheets to put it on ourselves. WTF  I didn't come here to pay for a room and to put on the sheets on myself. Then called front desk again  they send other people up and this time they say beds don't come with fitted sheets....lol I asked housekeeping why front desk didn't just tell me this on the phone  their reply was they probably don't know. Wow  goes to show how they've got things together at this hotel. \\n\\nThis is my first and last time here. Looks like this hotel won't last long. SLS you need to stay as a small hotel and not compete in Las Vegas. The hotels here are for the big dogs and you're not a fit for Vegas!!!",

It's quite inconvenient to make the 350 mile drive to California...and I crave Boiling Crab like  everyday.  \\n\\nThe concept is exactly the same as Boiling Crab - choose your seafood  choose your seasoning and choose your spice level.  There's a variety of fried seafood baskets that come with Cajun fries (or regular)  wings  various sides such as corn and sausage- again  exactly like BC.  Only thing is  this place is obviously more expensive  as we don't live by the sea and it costs more to acquire seafood.  \\n\\nAnyway.  We came in with a group of 5 at about 6 pm so this is right before the dinner rush  so the place was quite empty.  We put in our order of 2 lbs of clams  8 pieces of sausage  1 corn  Cajun fries  a dozen naked fried wings  and a side of macaroni salad.   And about 15 minutes later our food came out.  \\n\\n+ Taste/Flavor :  It has potential  it really does.  But our bag of seafood was not hot.  It was not even warm.  It was like  semi lukewarm  which translates to the combination of the butter and spices being completely separated and not mixed well to form any kind of harmonious deliciousness to coat the seafood.  The spices sat in globs throughout the bag  while the butter was stale.  Once we shake the hell out of the bag to attempt to mix the butter/spices  the overall flavor was good - not too salty  not to garlicky  but I ain't trying to mess with cold butter doughy globs of spices.  The wings were bland  but the texture was great.  Mac salad was just mac salad  corn is always good no matter what  sausage was sausage to me  and the cajun fries were the best part of my meal. They had a light breading that made 'em crunchy yet soft inside  and the seasoning was spot on. \\n\\n+ Service : Though our server was a nice person   his service is nothing to write home about.  He forgot our Cajun fries and macaroni salad  which weren't brought out til we nearly finished our food.  He only checked on us once and never refilled our drinks - I had to flag down another server.  It wasn't even busy at the time.  I usually don't complain about service  as I'd rather be left alone to eat in peace but when I keep having to ask for multiple things that should've been brought to me  it gets annoying.\\n\\nThose of us who are used to being spoiled by BC's deliciousness should keep an open mind when trying this place for the first time  as this ISN'T BC and it's a new restaurant and they're not established like BC  which is why I didn't come with high expectations.  It wasn't terrible  but it wasn't great.",

There are a couple of sinks to use to hose yourself off when you are done which was very handy too!

The park closes to minors at 9pm  so definitely has a lounge/bar feel with some of the restaurants that line the lower level.  I'm not sure if there is a live cover band all the time  but on Friday night they were playing on the back stage.  Love that the drummer does vocals for the covers =)  There is a large child/adult play area in the center...with a huge slide.  Kid friendly by day with a preying mantus that spits fire outside.  I've seen adults go down the slide too...so parents who are scared of creepers beware.  Cute little boutique shops with the matching price tag.  Overall  probably a good week end date night spot with all the little restaurant options.",

Because it is much closer to my house than the other location I use out in Henderson  I decided to give them another shot. Up until today  everything had been going fine with my routine visits for ejuice. Today  I came in to have them swap out a couple batteries for my Provari  that were no longer holding their charge. Keeping in mind that I bought my Provari from this specific Sin City Vapor location and was told when I purchased this that they DID in fact warranty these batteries (and had swapped them out for me when the previous batteries were no longer holding a charge) I was told today that their policy had changed and they have decided to no longer warranty them  because it wasn't cost effective. First of all  regardless of their decision to change policy  when you sell something to a customer and make a promise of service  you had better keep that promise and deliver on what you sold them. Secondly  this is just poor business. To treat a loyal customer this way  when they do in fact spend a lot of money with you  is unacceptable and the way you LOSE customers. I'm not asking for something free  not asking for a credit  I'm not even asking for something to be discounted! I'm asking and expecting that you honor something you sold to me when I purchased the Provari. I still have the original receipt showing the purchase and purchase date. As I PROMISED the guy in the store today  I'm leaving my 'negative' review to warn others of your poor business practices and will continue to write these reviews  until this is resolved. I will also be filing a complaint with the BBB  because this is unacceptable.",

I've been noticing these chains popping up all over the Dane County area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while I was in Sun Prairie.\\n\\nWhat I like is that as soon as you walk in  you're greeted by someone who helped you with the process if you're a first timer. This is very different from other sandwich places. You go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags. So if you want a turkey sandwich  you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have. They do the same for beef  tuna  veggie  chicken  etc. You grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag  you mark with a provided sharpie all of the toppings you want. This is a really neat idea. I liked the selection process. When you've marked your bag with all of your toppings  which they do provided a lot of choices I must admit  you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist. They put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections. Again  very cool idea. When're sandwich is done  they call you by name. There is a place on the bag for you to put your name down. \\n\\n\\nHowever  they are overpriced for their quality of food. You get to pick from three different bread sizes  6  10.5 and 14 inches. For a 10.5 inch  it's $8.25 if you don't add toppings that are priced extra.   The sandwich was just OK. Nothing special. They gave me the wrong mustard but it wasn't a huge deal. My biggest issue is that there isn't any combo special. At least that is not what was told to me. For a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips  it was over $10. Had I added a pop  I would have been close to $12. It's a lot of money for a sandwich that's very basic and some chips. If the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made  I totally could see the justification of price. However  the sandwich was just basic.  I prefer Quiznos or Pot Bellys over Which Wich to be honest. I had a lot of toppings on mines  but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish. I couldn't even taste the other toppings. \\n\\nDoubtful i'd return. They aren't  terribly bad but they are far from greatness. The experience of picking your sandwich is cool but that's really the only positive I have from my first time experience. I can at least day I tried it and seen what they had to offer. Now I know and I won't be returning. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere.",

        "text": "I hate to break your bubble of great reviews but I recently had an awful experience with this company. \\n\\nMy wife and I stumbled into this place on March and thought we would treat ourselves to some custom denim. Nicholas the GM  seemed pleasant to work with and did our fitting for a pair of Men's denim Jeans and a ladies mini skirt. The next morning I called lawless denim and spoke with Nicholas the GM and asked if there was anyway I could request a special color threading  I informed them that I would be more than willing to pay extra. 2 weeks went by and not a single call back or email letting me know if this was possible. So I took it upon myself to walk into the store to see if there was any progress. When I arrived the GM Nicholas was not in and the other manager Melissa had but didn't seem to know what was going on so I requested to have Nicholas the GM call me. I waited another 5 days again with no call back so I took upon myself to call them again  this time Nicholas the GM answered. There was no apology for the lack of follow up and when I asked about the thread he said it would be too much work for me??  To say the least I was a bit disappointed with the fact that I waited all this time for nothing. The following day I decided to call again because I got the impression that Nicholas the GM made no effort to help me. This time I spoke to Melissa  I informed her of the issues and she informed me that they could get the threading I requested but now I would have to wait after already waiting 2 plus weeks I'd have to wait 7-10 day plus that didn't include the build time of the jeans so now I'd be waiting nearly a month with an additional cost of $289.  Yikes!!\\n\\nI asked them to please compromise with me since I had been waiting patiently and had already informed the GM Nicholas that I would be happy to spend the extra money to get what I requested but now we were looking at a month later. \\n\\nThey were unwilling to compromise so I informed them to go ahead with the original request but that I would need them a day earlier then the deadline of 2 1/2 weeks. Melissa informed me that it would be no problem. \\n\\nSo then 2 days before I needed to have them I called again and was informed that I should come in for my second fitting. I came down on my lunch hour and the jeans were NOT READY!!!!! So I left and came back later in the day. \\n\\nTo say the least I was very upset at this point  I felt I had made many efforts and had a lot of my time wasted. Then to make things even worse when I came back the MATERIALS I REQUESTED WERE NOT CORRECT!!!! WTF?? \\n\\nNicholas the GM  was back at the store and approached me and knew I was not happy. Instead of apologizing for his lack luster follow up or poor communication he just went about his day and pretended like nothing was wrong.\\n\\nSo as I was walking out of the store I noticed a denim shirt. I inquired about it and asked if I could get the shirt expedited so that I could wear the jeans and the shirt for my event. Melissa said she couldn't promise it but that they would do their best to make it happen. I informed her if she could make this happen I would again be a happy customer and to please inform the owner I would be ever so appreciative.\\n\\nTHE DEADLINE: I was called and was informed that my jeans were ready!! I was excited but then I asked about the shirt and was now told that NO EXTRA EFFORT WOULD BE MADE TO EXPEDITED THE SHIRT. So I told Nicholas the GM  if that was the case I no longer wanted the jeans nor the shirt and would like them refunded.\\n\\nI requested to please have the OWNER ROMAN  call me because I thought it was imperative that he knew about what was going on in his store.\\n\\nInstead at 3:30 I received an email from Nicholas the GM  no phone call from the OWNER ROMAN  instead Nicholas the GM was  informing me that it wasn't his fault blah blah blah and that he would refund the cost of the shirt but not the jeans.\\n\\nSo I wrote him back and said all I am looking for is a call from the owner or anyone who could please help me with this horrific experience!! \\n\\nThe next email  I received was to inform me that they no longer wanted to do business with me and to please pick up the jeans and bring in the credit card for the shirt so they could refund me.\\n\\nIF YOU ARE A CUSTOM JEAN COMPANY YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO DO CUSTOM REQUEST AND BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE CUSTOMER END OF STORY\\n\\nIF I COULD I'D GIVE THEM NEGATIVE STARS..",

There are countless issues since we have lived here.\\n\\n1. Maintenance requests will take a while to fill. (Be warned) I had put in a request that my dishwasher was leaving a nasty residue  and I receive a call almost 2 weeks later asking me if I had run vinegar through the wash. (YES...I had  but thanks for asking 2 weeks later!) I had also put in a maintenance request because the knob would fall off of my dryer often. It fell off a total of 3 times  each time necessitating an order for repair. When they finally replaced the dryer  it was much older and now does not turn off on its own. \\n\\n2. The water has been shut off 3 or more times. (often without warning) And  it's been off as long as an entire work day. Not to mention  I can never take a bath because the hot water runs cold in about 5 minutes. \\n\\n3. My parking spot is a good walk from my actual unit. When Brent was working here  he assigned me a new spot right in front of my apartment around 8 months into my lease. I was very grateful  come to find out management has reassigned my spot to the apartment next door. Brent told me this would be my new permanent spot  and not a temporary solution. Brent doesn't work here anymore  so I guess they don't feel the need to stand behind the word of a previous employee.\\n\\n4. Several of the staff are rude and unprofessional. I had to go have my gate card reprogrammed  and the office worker treated me like a nuisance. A different time  my husband went into the office to grab a package. The worker asked him to wait 10 minutes  because it had been crazy busy. Are you serious? To pick up a package? Get your act together! Hire more staff if you're that overwhelmed. Not to mention  almost every time I step foot in the office  there is a disgruntled renter complaining and asking to speak to the manager.\\n\\n5. I live on the second floor  and I hear every foot step up and down the stairs. I have a sleeping baby  and the noise level from the stairs has been difficult to deal with. \\n\\n6. My neighbors (downstairs and next door) both moved out around the same time. The units were renovated  and they woke up my sleeping baby almost every day for a couple weeks. So  be prepared for renovation above  below  and next door:)\\n\\n7. I went to change my air filter about a month ago (on my own  because I wasn't going to wait a week for it to be changed)  and it looked as if it hadn't been changed in about 3 years. (we have lived here about 10 months) I've never seen such a gross air filter:/ \\n\\n8. They are raising their prices significantly  and the customer service has gone way down. My extended family used to live here when it was Acacia Creek (under different management)...and had a good experience. My fellow renters have told me they are having similar issues.  \\n\\nI hope you have found this review helpful. It is very honest  but I would have appreciated having this information prior to signing a year lease.",

Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city (Kansas City brisket  Memphis pulled pork  St.louis ribs  etc.) so the place really didn't have it's own identity. The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example  the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy  basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it  so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising  but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side  not BBQ sauce on top).

There was only 4 pcs and I gave up on the 3rd one. A BBQ joint should always have good ribs.\\nSecond the pulled pork. That pork was so dry and chewy also; even L&L hawaiian bbq does a better job at it even at late hours!. The sauce is not evenly spread out. \\nA BBQ joint should have a good sauce and yes the sauce was good considering they only had one flavor that's comparable to the ones I buy at albertsons. \\nNext I had the pork and beans...i don't know why the people next to me was saying it's good when it clearly taste like the ones I use to buy at walmart. No special taste there. To be honest I use to buy it as dog food. \\nAlso did the Potato salad....that was horrible even my kid pointed out it was bad. I also had him try the cup of water telling him it's refreshing. He's reaction?? x[ like that. lol and last the dinner roll. Smh.. \\n\\nFor the price I'd recommend going to Famous Daves. They have a variety of sauces and the quality is always consistent.  I don't know if I went to Big Erns late but 5 pm there was still lots of people so there shouldn't be an excuse to serve it like that. \\nAlso people should not always believe on over hyped places. Don't believe it till you try it cause most often it mind f***s u and u start to believe it's good. Believe in your taste buds ;)",

Myself and others were blatantly lied to that there would be no construction.  Two weeks in  it starts every night  all night at midnight and goes until around 5pm.  Be prepared for constant loud hammering and drilling on a nightly basis.  Want a good night's sleep before an exam?  Better off crashing with a friend  or on the sidewalk for that matter.\\n\\n2.  The elevators.  The waits often take 10-15 minutes  and they randomly stop working at the worst possible times.  One Saturday night  the night of a football game  ALL FOUR elevators stopped working.  Have fun walking up to the 19th floor along with the rest of the residents.\\n\\n3.  Maintenance requests are constantly ignored.

Before my initial thoughts  here's the back story.\\n\\nAfter speaking with the owner Mike and the nice server Celeste  I found out that this place is an actual truck stop/wash. They decided to start serving breakfast and lunch because of all the numerous truckers coming in complaining about eating fast food at the McDonald's on the corner.\\n\\nSo SNS Diner (SNS stands for Southern Nevada Services) was born. They have been open for about a year. They are located off of Colton but the main cross street is Losee Road. As soon as you turn on to Colton  the place is on your right. Just look for the barbeque signs. At first look you might think that this place could be where they would film a CSI episode. But after coming out of your car  the smell of would smoke (hickory maybe? I should of asked) should tell you that there is some good smoking going on and im not talking about weed.\\n\\nNow for main reasons why you should go here: The good food and great service.\\n\\nFor breakfast I have had the Biscuits and Gravy ($6.99)  Pastrami Hash ($8.99)  Eggs Benedict ($8.99)  and 2 Eggs over easy with Bacon and Potatoes (6.99).\\n\\nThe Biscuits and Gravy came highly recommended so that was the first item my wife was looking forward to. The gravy itself has breakfast sausage mixed in it and had a little bit of a kick to it. After taking one bite you will know that the biscuits were made fresh from scratch.\\n\\nThe Pastrami Hash was just a tad bit salty but with a bit of ketchup or barbeque sauce it rounds out the flavor. I can only assume the bit of saltiness is from the chopped up bits of pastrami. With that it is comprised of green peppers  onions  scrambled eggs  and black pepper. It it topped off with 2 fried eggs cooked to your liking.\\n\\nThe Eggs Benedict were decent. They were definitely better than the ones I had a couple weeks ago at another breakfast joint.\\n\\nThe 2 eggs and bacon with home fries were just average.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor lunch  (this is where they will definitely keep me coming back) I have had the 3 Meat Combo ($13.99) and the Rib Tip Sandwich ($8.50).\\n\\nThe 3 Meat Combo you have your choice of ribs  chicken  brisket  or pulled pork  all which have been smoked for whatever designated time they did it for. I went with ribs  brisket  and pulled pork. The St Louis Ribs have this rub on it that makes it very flavorful. It's not fall off the bone tender but tender enough for you to eat it off the bone with ease. The Brisket was juicy and tender as well. The Pulled Pork was good too. The common theme for all these meats is that they all have the great smoke flavoring and are not dry at all as evidenced by the juices at the bottom of your foil lining of your basket.\\n\\nThe Rib Tip Sandwich originally I thought it said Tri Tip so when I got my sandwich I was surprised to see that the chopped bits of meat were actually rib tips. Nevertheless it was good. So good in fact that I didnt even need the bread just to eat the meat! Dont get me wrong  the bread was good too! It was all buttered up and grilled to a slight crispiness on the inner portion. the rib tips also had a mixture of some kind of rub that has a kick to it. The plate comes with Carolina Mustard and a Vinaigrette Slaw that is usually in the sandwich but they will ask you if you want it on the side instead of inside the sandwich. Both plates come with your choice of one side which consists of Mac n Cheese  Smoked Beans  Smoked Beans and Rice  Green Salad  Vinaigrette Slaw  or Potato Salad. All are good choices.\\n\\nService is excellent! Celeste constantly walks around making sure you are ok. Sometimes Mike the owner will stop by and confirm that everything was ok.\\n\\nSome random info: Business hours are Monday thru friday 7 am to 4 pm and Saturday 7 am to 2 pm. Closed Sundays. Breakfast hours are until 10 am. You can only order breakfast. After 10 lunch items only. They take cards.\\n\\nIn closing  I say give this place a chance. Even though it is kind of in a hidden spot  you will definitely remember where they are once you eat here! I know the hours dont extend into the dinner slot but you gotta remember  this place was originally for truckers making their way through town during the day. Im sure once they start getting busier the owner will have to do something about it  which was pretty much my last comment right before I left. Also I keep wanting to try their berry cobbler which other Yelpers have mentioned but I always find myself too full to order it! \\n\\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #194",

        "text": "It was actually easy getting in on a Saturday night  there wasn't a line and there was no cover charge. The guys at the front were very easy going and friendly. Once you walk in there's a bar on the right and then another bar at the far end of the club. There's a large dance floor in between and a few couches to sit in and open areas to mingle and chat in. There's also a reserved area on top (2nd level) to the left of the club. \\n\\nThere weren't any lines at the bathrooms and they were beautiful and clean. \\n\\nThe drinks were decently priced and tasted great  a nice combo! One of the few AMF's that I've actually liked  and $10. So not too bad!\\n\\nThe club itself wasn't as packed as I'd liked it to be. For instance if it's a dance floor and you stand at one end - when you look through the crowd dancing you should not see the other side. That's how I like it. And The Mint  Maya  and Red Revolver can get that packed but this place wasn't (and on a Saturday night  gosh!).\\n\\nIt also had a friendly vibe  not much of a wink wink hey what's up  everyone seemed to be dancing with their homies. The crowd was also 95% white  not that it's a problem but some people like variety. Like variety? Go to The Mint or Smashboxx.\\n\\nThe male to female ratio was decent  go ahead laugh but you know that's also important. \\n\\nSomething this place does right is class. It's streamlined  and the decor and setting is spot on for a laid back and nice club. \\n\\nAlso  this place has an outdoor patio for those that need it. \\n\\nI'll be back with friends. But if I'm going alone for a hot night  I'd much rather spend it at The Mint or Maya.",

        "text": "\"I feel bad for giving this one star  as MOST of the servers and bartenders were excellent. \\n\\nHowever  tonight.... we were there after my best friend's wedding  which was at the resort (which I will also write a review for  and will be MUCH better than this review). We arrived there at midnight  having been told by the wedding coordinator that they will stay open until two. We sat down at the large fire pit. Not two seconds after we sat down  I guess some sort of incident/ bar fight happened. Not at all the fault of the bar  I get that and I'm not blaming anyone for that. \\n\\nWhat I DID NOT appreciate was the aftermath and how the situation was handled. First off  a server named Kay came over and RUDELY said \\\"\"\"\"I'm turning this off\\\"\"\"\" (fire pit) and said the bar's closed  you have to leave. The bride explained we had been told the bar was open until 2. Kay responded \\\"\"\"\"Honey  I don't make the hours.\\\"\"\"\" Maybe Kay was having a bad day  maybe Kay was told by a manager that we couldn't be there.... I don't care. But don't speak that way to a bride at your resort!!\\n\\nNEXT... we sat there for another couple of minutes because we weren't aware of the incidient/bar fight occuring feet away from us and because we figured we would um... FINISH OUR DRINKS and then leave. Some security guard walks over  looks straight at the bride  and says \\\"\"\"\"You were asked to leave and you have to go now\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nMy best friend left IN TEARS. IN TEARS!!! She ended her wedding night crying because she was yelled at by staff members of this resort  and felt she had been lied to since she was told the bar closed at 2. Her sister  a close family friend  and myself stayed behind to speak to a manager about the way she was treated. \\n\\nThis is when we spoke to Krysta. Might have got the spelling wrong on her name.... but really who cares if I spell her name wrong... she was SO DISREPECTFUL of the bride's sister and our family friend who was being very respectful and explaining that we simply wanted something done. I just wanted a freaking apology! She got someone else to come over  Cheri. Cheri was nice and helped us out. It DID take her an hour.. which to me was a wasted hour that she or Krysta could have already gone out and apologized to the bride. When I pointed this out to Krysta  her response was \\\"\"\"\"well an apology isn't going to do any good at this point\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nUM... YES IT IS! It will show that you actually care that a BRIDE at your resort had a bad experience. Krysta tried using so many excuses and was so rude to us every step of the way. \\n\\nI worked in customer service for 12 years and I understand when things are out of your control. I understand snapping at people.... and for that reason I don't really blame Kay for responding the way she did. And I appreciate Cheri trying to help. But Krysta... there is no excuse for her. She's supposed to be a manager. Managers have calm and courteous demeanors... NOTHING like hers. \\n\\nI am just so appalled at how the whole situation was handled  Cheri made it right at the end but it never should have gotten to the point that it did. It was not our fault an incident happened with another party and it was certainly not our responsiblity to read minds and know exactly what was happening and know that we were somewhere we weren't supposed to be. A much simpler way tto approach it  for both the security guard and Kay  would have been to say \\\"\"\"\"I'm sorry ladies but we have an incident going on so we are going to have to have you leave this area.\\\"\"\"\" Doesn't take a genius to figure that out!\"",

Very knowledgeable and quick to point out that they have some exclusive things that nobody else in town has.... He also made it a point to ask me what type of equipment I had and what level I was at as well and what brands of juices I use  He recognize the brands and told me what they had in stock and invited me to the store.... \\\"\"\"\"Come down and check out the store hang out a bit and try our juices\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nnow I could just head on down there  it is on the other side of town from where I live....

I was pleasantly surprised it's a beautifully designed modern store seemingly focused on quality over quantity.... A very well laid out floor plan and a really nice stainless steel juice bar!.... It reminded me of an Apple Store.... Very clean and concise!.... I was greeted immediately as I walk to the door by the whole staff.... I was shown a few new things there like a French MOD I haven't heard of before  called Titianide it's all titanium  the Themis named after a Greek goddess.... It is sexy!..... I swapped some build stories got some good advice too..... I picked up some juice and some build supplies and was offered a sample of bio wick to try as well!....\\n\\nIf you're looking to get started with vaping or if you are already an advance builder VAPECO  has pretty much everything you're going to need....

I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.  \\n\\nOnce I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  \\n\\nWell......that is not exactly the way it turned out. \\n\\nI've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  \\n\\nEach time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact  they seemed stressed   grumpy  and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  \\n\\nI'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership  you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  \\n\\nOnce we navigated the line and survived the slow service  we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left  and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said  is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So  they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  \\n\\nBy this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case  an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap  but come on  stop being so chincy  CR. \\n\\nI've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller  the prices have gone up  the service has gone south  and now we are no longer loyal customers.",

Like maybe some kidneys or liver?  My only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough temperature wise.  However  we did come right after they opened  so maybe it just wasn't heated through yet.\\n\\n- Cali burrito...ohhh  how I miss these from my San Diego days.  And no one in Vegas seems to get them quite right.  Desnudo is no exception  unfortunately.  A good Cali burrito has French fries in it  not potatoes!  But the carne is deliciously seasoned.\\n\\n- Hongos Taco...mushroom are my love.  And the mushrooms in this taco were meaty and hearty and tasty.  A little spicy sauce wraps it all up into one hell of a taco.\\n\\n- Chivo Taco...it's freaking goat meat.  I've never had goat meat  but it ended up being my favorite thing of all.  It tastes very similar to lamb  and boy is it tasty on this taco.  Add a little of their smoky red sauce and you got the winner winner chicken dinner (or should I say goat dinner) here!\\n\\nMost definitely visiting this place again.

Which is a good thing! Sometimes you want a nude taco  sometimes you don't. \\n\\nActually  it was only after reading Mike's review that I realized how many ingredients go into each taco. Wowzers. And the taste in the final product shows the love and care put into the ingredients. Desnudo tacos are some great tacos. \\n\\nMy favorite was the Tinga Poblana (Pork Shoulder  Chorizo  Chipotle  Tomato  Tomatillo  Roasted Garlic  Avocado  Crema ). Tinga poblana is a stew made from pork and chipotle and the result is that the meat comes out tender and flavorful. Desnudo's version does not disappoint. I haven't tried many versions of Tinga Poblana but I don't have to  I think I found one of the best. I highly recommend it   head and shoulders over the carnitas  which the bf had. The carnitas were good too but the Tinga was special. \\n\\nMy new BFF (best foodie friend) was more adventurous and went with the Chivo (goat meat). As a child  I hated goat and lamb  and the gamey taste it left in my mouth. But the last few years  I've learned to love lamb  and now  Desnudo has me loving goat meat!  The goat was tender and flavorful  with a slight gamey-goat taste  which was pleasant to the palate and oh  so good to the tummy. I'd get these again. \\n\\nHonorable mention to the Mango-Lime Ceviche  the scallops were tender perfection. TBH: I didn't see any mangoes  maybe they only use the juice. Hongos tacos were good too  they used a mushroom mixture that had enoki  but I thought it was a bit salty. \\n\\nIn conclusion  this is a high-styling place. I think I invented a new word: GASTROSTAND. LOL. Desnudo is a gastro-taco-stand. It has the feel of a taco stand but they serve high-end food and drink (which I will imbibe in next time).

There was no choice between flour and corn tortillas which probably should have been the first sign  the pork belly and the pulled pork in the torta was hard and overcooked.

As to reviews by Winston R. and Meh M.  typical Yelp passive aggressive haters.  Believe the hype  this place is for real.  Yummy!",

If it is your first time there the servers warn you not to expect large portions and suggest you order several plates if you want more of a variety. With this in mind I ordered the shrimp risotto and the salmon. The risotto came with jumbo shrimp and was a little more al dente in some parts than I would have cared for but was still good. I also ordered the grilled salmon which was ok on its own BUT to me what really made the plate outstanding was the bed of oyster mushrooms that the salmon was served on. The combination of the salmon and the mushrooms makes this plate a must try. I was sufficiently satisfied after both of these plates. My dining companion ordered the half roasted chicken. Unfortunately  the plate lacked the wow factor the salmon had  and the chicken lacked any flavor on its own  and the broccolini it came with was way overcooked and inedible. We ended up having to add salt to give the chicken any flavor. The manager also surprised us with a mini cheesecake for my birthday (yay!)  which I thought was nice. To top off the meal I had a Smith & Forge hard cider (yum!) and my companion had some drink (can't remember the name) that had raspberries in it. Unfortunately  the bartender who made it forgot to strain the seeds out  making it impossible to drink  and it had to be sent back. I had to knock a star off for the lack of flavor in the the chicken and the inconvenience of the drink. Would I come here again? Absolutely. Would I recommend you give it a try? Absolutely!",

This particular location warrants a totally different experience although technically the product should be the same.  \\n\\nOne of the biggest differences is that they sell bulk items of powders  mixes  toppings  straws  etc.  It can look rather warehouse-like since it's where they keep inventory.  But if you're in the market  then it's a good thing.\\n\\nOn our first visit  the restroom was flooded.  Sure  that couldn't be helped and maybe a nice sign on the door advising customers that it was out of order would have sufficed.  \\n\\nAt this particular location  you cannot look into the ice cream case like almost all ice cream stores allow.  Therefore  you are basing your decision purely on what's listed on the menu posted rather than what looks visually appealing.  (Of course  you can ask for samples too.)  However  keep in mind that although it's posted on the menu  you still have to ask if they have it.  The menu does not reflect what they currently have in stock.  One of the things I enjoyed from their other location was their Green Tea Milkshake.  When I attempted to order it from here  they had the green tea ice cream but they were out of soy and almond milk.  So  I was stuck with regular milk.  (This ultimately meant anyone looking for a vegan milkshake was out of luck.)  They were out of a quite of few vegan ice cream flavors too  and I saw a few customers leave once they discovered this.\\n\\nOn our second visit  I attempted to call three times to ask about specific flavors before making the drive over.  No answer.  Were they even open?  When we arrived  they were open.  I asked the girl working what the phone number was and she had no idea.  Then she told me their phone wasn't working either. Okay. (Their credit card machine was down too.)\\n\\nThe restroom was working this time  but there was no toilet paper  paper towels  or soap.  Not a good sign.\\n\\nThe same girl was working and she was by herself again.  When she was helping my party  a guy came in and turned on the lights.  (Apparently they were off.)  He stood by the register and started flipping through the receipt book. I asked if he was the owner and he said he was the partner.  There was obviously quite a few customers waiting in line and one would think he'd jump in and help out but this was not the case.\\n\\nWhen I asked again about soy milk or almond milk  she said they were out.  And so I asked about regular milk and she said they were out of that too.  (I had watched her make three milkshakes already.)  So  what was she using?  Half and half.  Oh. Hmm...half and half?  At this point  I had waited so long for my milkshake I just said okay.  Well  it was a mistake.  It didn't taste the same and for someone who is lactose intolerant  it sure affected me differently.  I won't be having a milkshake made with half & half anytime soon.\\n\\nOther things that could use some serious improvements are how the staff are taught to rinse/wash the items.  For example  the ice cream scooper and Vitamix tamper stick were rinsed and she used her hand to 'rub it' under the water.  And watching her loose long hair hang over the deep freezer is not a good thing.  Rubber floor mats behind the counter are a necessity  especially when you can see how wet the floor is.  And ultimately  anyone running a register should know basic addition and subtraction  especially for simple transactions.  On both occasions we had to help her with transactions because she entered them into the register incorrectly.  I blame the management on the poorly trained staff  the lack of basic supplies  and the lack of teamwork.  We were glad to use up the last of our Groupons here because we have no intention of coming back.",

I think it has potential but they're a little confused on their identity and definitely need to reconsider their pricing. Here are a few observations:\\n\\n- Pricing is way too high. This isn't Scottsdale and it's not nice enough to get away with the high prices being located off of Baseline in Tempe. As soon as happy hour ended the bar cleared out and everyone went next door to Pier 54.\\n\\n- The food is ok but the menu is kind of all over the place. \\n\\n- The place turns into a \\\"\"\"\"nightclub\\\"\"\"\" after 8/9ish on the weekends. That was an immediate turn off for us (and we're in our early 30s). It was pretty cheesy.\\n\\n- Gorgeous views  but the weird uplighting inside the bar reflected off the glass and skewed the view.\\n\\n- Bathrooms are awful. Both my fianc\\u00e9 and I commented on how you could tell they skipped rehabbing the bathrooms and how important that was in a new restaurant. \\n\\n- There is a cool pool table room in the back and games on the patio but no one was in there. I think this goes back to pricing and a confused identity. \\n\\n- Our waitress (I think her name was Bailey) was awesome! Very attentive and personable.\\n\\nWorth checking out for the view alone  but without defining their identity and lowering their prices  I give the place 6 months to a year.\"",

The dan dan noodles were very bland and only slightly spiced with sambal chili sauce which did little to add any flavor other than spice to the dish.  I found myself reaching for anything on the table to add flavor (sriracha  soy sauce  and lime juice) which helped but still was missing something.  The marinated steak had some flavor to it  but many pieces were cut with the grain which made them extra tough to chew.  My wife's Mongolian chicken was just as bland  the only difference between the two dishes was slightly spicy vs. slightly sweet.  The spring rolls were clearly frozen and not made in house as the little vegetables were soggy.  The best thing I ate were my sons' chicken tenders  crunchy and tender.

They wouldn't give me back my money.   Worst place to get lashes.  Buyers be aware!!!! They don't last either.  It's only been two days and half of my lashes are falling off   and it looks terrible. It's not consistent with the direction the lashes are going.  It's all over the place. I even showed up to the business and yet still they won't give me my money back.  They made me wait over an hour to talk to a manager.  She's too busy too talk to a customer. Pictures are worth thousand words!!!",

I watched a few episode of Food Network \\\"\"\"\"Restaurant's Express and so that's how i knew of the Executive Chef for this restaurant. Of course it was a plus she was Korean...gotta support my peoples :)\\n\\nWe arrived right when they opened (5pm) so there was no wait! As i skimmed through the menu  i saw alot of authetic korean dishes in which was awesome. I was quite interested in seeing how they would execute the taste since I grew up with Korean food. The portions were smaller than i'm used to but the flavor of everything was superb! This is what we ordered:\\n\\nKorean Lobster-This dish reminded me of many chinese type dishes i've had in the past with the usual ginger and soy sauce base flavor but i love how they added a twist by making it korean  as it's name  by adding some korean pork  spices and veggies. There wasn't that much lobster pieces but in other restaurant dishes....they really isn't in the first place. I would definately eat this again...but maybe next time i'll order two for just myself..oink oink!\\nPork Wrap-This was a fancy upgrade to what i'm used to  Samgyupsal (korean name for it). It tasted the similar but again with special additional ingredients.  Nice appetizer instead of just a salad. They give you four pieces. \\nKalbi Rib-This was sweeter than the normal kalbi i'm used to. The beef quality was great but i wasn't really digging the extra sweetness. You can definately taste the kalbi that you usually eat but with a thicker teriyaki like sauce. I would've like them to have brought this out with white rice or something to neutralize the sweetness.\\nKimchee Fried Rice-This was my absolute favorite of the dishes! OMG it's just like mom makes it but this extra spice/seasoning that kicks you to want more in your mouth. CRACK would be a better word. More please?!?!?!?!?\\n\\nSince it seems like they have mostly korean dishes  i wish the name and decor was more \\\"\"\"\"korean\\\"\"\"\" themed though.They have the green for chinese and the cherry blossoms for japanese......Oh well maybe later if they ever remodel. =)\"",

Though I never ate at the former location in Bethel Park  I wrongly assumed that an established business would have good food and good service. \\n\\nThe very young hostess seated us right by the door on a day when it was 27 degrees outside. There were at least 10 empty tables where she could have seated us. She just wanted us to sit down so that she could go back to talking to her friend who was sitting at a nearby table. \\n\\nThere was a man who I gather is the owner seated at the table next to us who heard us talk about how cold it was. He even watched me put my coat on because it was THAT cold. He had a small space heater at his feet and enough meat on his bones so I assume he didn't notice that it was freezing. \\n\\nI looked past that because I was so excited that the Pub and Pizza building was finally occupied again. We anxiously waited for our server to come and take our orders. We didn't wait too long. \\n\\nThe woman was friendly enough but when we asked what they have to drink  she said she didn't know because she doesn't have a list. We asked if they have beer and she said yes then proceeded to list off your standard dive bar drafts and a vanilla 'port.' Um... Porter? \\n\\nWe ordered our drinks as well as a pizza and some provolone sticks. When the pizza came she put it on a wobbly pizza stand and dropped off the cheese sticks. The pizza stand was so wobbly I thought the pizza may slide off. \\n\\nThe food didn't look good. The cheese sticks weren't browned. They were sad  skinny sticks that were taken out of the freezer and dropped in the fryer. I've had better cheese sticks in a cafeteria. \\n\\nAs for the pizza  it was terrible. Soggy and shiny - two things that food should not be. I'm sorry but if you have 'pizza' in your name  you should at least have a decent pie. It's laughable considering all of the good pizza in a 2 mile radius of the joint. \\n\\nWe finished what we could and wanted to leave but our server disappeared. I went to the bar to ask if we could cash out. The bartender looked at me as if I were an alien. The owner rolled his eyes. He didn't even seem to care that his employees was\\nweren't taking very good care of his customers. \\n\\nRather than cash me out  the bartender went to find the server. Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to take our card. \\n\\nAll in all it was a bad experience. By the time we left we felt like the place didn't want customers. It's sad because they are in a good location. They won't last long unless they do huge business selling bud light and karaoke.",

Mind you  we told them when scheduling the appointment that we were on a time crunch so we would book if they could guarantee that there would be 4 technicians so we could all get our pedis/manis done at the same time. They had said it would not be a problem. We waited for about 30 minutes until the owner came over and said we could get started soaking at the mani station for one girl. The technicians then informed her that we couldn't because the 2 girls they had taken before us were getting manis now too. So  then my girl had to sit in a random chair soaking her nails for no reason. Then they set me and another girl up in the pedi station. We sat with our feet in the water only to look down and realize that the bubbles in the water had dead skin floating in it. Absolutely unsanitary and disgusting. Most nail salons I go to put a disposable plastic tub inside of the tub so there is no issue of this.

One of the better things about this complex when I moved in was the utilities (paid partially by myself and partially by the owners).  During the summer my AC was on 24/7  my electric bill was never over $120  for the last few months I have notice a pretty good increase in my bill (last bill was $160)  which I can't seem to justify  since I have not yet even turned my heat on and rarely cook  am rarely home  therefore electricity or water should not be being used hardly at all.  After speaking with some neighbors who have also noticed this happening  it was brought to my attention that every vacant apartment in the complex has all the lights on 24/7.  Since the new owners took over the property there have been a lot more vacancies.  Now I understand why my electric has increased  I am paying to keep all those vacant apartments well lit all day and all night.  I brought this to the attention of management and was basically patronized and spoke to in a very condescending way by one of the staff members  which also by the way are all new since the new owners  also are all very rude and completely unconcerned with current tenants.  \\n\\nThis complex has gone from a once very decent Scottsdale apartment to what seems like a shady  unkept South Phoenix apartment.  These new owners are absolutely horrible and are robbing each and every tenant monthly on our utility bills.  Coincidentally I signed my new lease with the previous owners exactly 3 days prior to the new ones taking over  nobody ever mentioned there would be new owners.  I'm hoping between the utility robbing and my lease being signed with a different management company I will be able to get out of it and get the heck out of that complex.  I strongly would NOT recommend this complex to anyone.  I agree 100% with Jeff H on the rating for new management  in fact -9.5 stars is probably being a little kind.\\n\\nThere is a very good reason why there are so many vacancies Ben S.   the place is a dump!!!!!!",

They're located in a run down building  which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door  perhaps from a prior break-in?  the carpet is worn down to nothingness  the fluorescent lights are overwhelming  and blinding  which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant  and the senses are left confused and probably offended.\\nThe menu is decent  it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing  with everything from crawfish and oysters  to turkey and gravy  and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic  and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming  and after ordering  for a brief moment  you're left feeling optimistic.\\nBut here again  the weird  decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner  being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups  staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time  and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains  low-quality  inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere  the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage  and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad  and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen  cursing everything.\\nThe food  was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily  the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest  lowest  lowest quality.  I ordered the \\\"\"\"\"Ragin Cajun \\\"\"\"\" which was to come with turkey  gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved  fresh turkey slices  smothered in hot gravy  and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices  made from waaaay over processed \\\"\"\"\"meat \\\"\"\"\" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \\\"\"\"\"meat.\\\"\"\"\"  It was served warm-ish  with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross  I couldn't eat it.\\n\\nOverall  with even the slightest investment  this could be a great Las Vegas eatery  but it's location  the building  and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back  and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry  that's the kiss of death.\"",

It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT  however  is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce  a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me  I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides  not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow  I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese  ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.",

Her lack of dancing was even more evident when she did try to half-a** dance when surrounding by her truly incredible  and talented dancers.

Inside the Cosmo  I have to say it is a bit difficult to find but as long as you look for directions to the Wicked Spoon  it's right next door. While waiting to go inside  I noticed many people go up to the bouncers and ask if it was the Wicked Spoon  it was kind of funny actually because the bouncers showed them it's right next to it without having an annoyed look on their face. I can't imagine how many times they are asked that question  because the entrances are really too close together. \\n\\nFrom the outside you have no idea what to expect. There are big doors that you can't see in and get a peek what is happening inside. I have to say  I wouldn't know it is a restaurant inside if I did not read the reviews. It's not a restaurant in which you can walk up  see the menu posted  and see the seating from the from of it and ask the hostess to seat you. Later on I spoke with the manager and he told me you need reservations normally. It is not very \\\"\"\"\"inviting\\\"\"\"\" from the outside  so I am assuming they don't get many people just walking by wanting to come in  since you really can't tell what's behind the closed doors  giving it some mystery. \\n\\nThere were about 8-10 hosts/guards standing outside and letting people in  making it feel exclusive to gain entry. When we walked through the doors  there was a room almost like a rotunda with more rooms with closed doors. We were led to the theater room. I was impressed when I entered. I liked the music  the small venue  the dim lights and there are 2 bars on each side of the round stage and seating area. The drinks were free but to me  very watered down taste and nothing special. I am hoping that the drinks everyone raves about in the other reviews are much better  because they are paying top dollar for those drinks. Since mine were free  I could not complain much. \\n\\nWe get seated and the show starts  first with some comedy which I found offensive at times and just not funny at all. The acts  most were pretty entertaining and kept my interest. The contortionist (disturbing)  dragon guy (annoying and not funny) his dog was the cutest part but it was also really sad as the dog was shaking and scared. The tightrope walker  walked and jumped  nothing amazing. The acts I did enjoy were the balancing act  hottie in the bathtub  fire girl  wine glass music  and the others. I don't think the acts amazed me  but it kept my interest to wonder what was next. \\n\\nComedy -1 star\\nVenue/Concept/Intimate vibe/connecting rooms- 5 stars\\n\\nI think if I had paid for the tickets  I am not sure it's worth the price I saw on their website. I am curious to try the restaurant even though it looks really pricey and supposedly the acts that are on the stage  those people wander throughout the bar/restaurant and do a little \\\"\"\"\"scene\\\"\"\"\" from whatever they did on the stage. I wonder if this is seen from the restaurant room or only the VIP area with the couches/restaurant area? I am curious about that. \\n\\nAs I walked around  I loved the idea of different rooms and found them to be quite unique.  I did see the people who were up on the stage socializing after in the bar area. I am not sure if this is how it usually is or because it was the grand opening night. \\n\\nI am now interested in seeing Absinthe.I also have to note that every employee I encountered there was very friendly and nice!!!\"",

Made the reservation on Open Table 3 days before - no problem.\\n\\nI was a bit thrown off in the beginning. You see someone at the front door  who then shows you to someone else.  That someone then walks you inside  where you are greeted by another person  and then taken to a \\\"\"\"\"holding area.\\\"\"\"\"  Then that person  after trying to sell you the $130 per person show  checks you in.  After all this  you are escorted to your table.  \\n\\nThe dining room is on the smaller side (as compared to other Vegas eating establishments)  and has a lively  yet intimate feeling.  There is an awkward elegance about the whole thing - from the way the wait staff isdressed to the chandeliers  it all screams Mad Hatter chic.  \\n\\nDrink: we ordered a $45 flask filled with the most delicious vodka concoction.  The name escapes me (Blue Moon maybe?)  but it was light blue in color and absolutely delicious.  We were apprehensive about the price at first  but it gave all 3 of us a very nice buzz   and we got to keep the flask.  We almost ordered another one... almost.  \\n\\nFood breakdown:\\n- herb brioche rolls: just the butter alone is worth the $4.  Quite possibly the best butter I've ever tasted.   \\n- vegetable crudite: interesting presentation  but a pass at $15.  Veggies are baby-sized (couple of baby carrots  some baby radishes)  and the mushroom floor (spongy in texture) and green goddess sauce - although nice on the palate - do not justify the price.  \\n- curried cauliflower: one of my favorites.  The portion was small  but flavors were spot-on.\\n- brussel sprouts: asked for it sans crispy chicken skin  and they were able to accommodate.  Tasty; cooked to perfection.   \\n- heavenly eggs: extremely fragile so be careful when handling. (I learned the hard way). Small in size but big in flavor - they don't skimp on the truffle. \\n- oysters on the 1/2 shell: friends enjoyed it  but stated they were \\\"\"\"\"thin.\\\"\"\"\"  I don't eat oyesters so I have no idea what that meant  and was too tipsy at that point to ask.\\n- mushroom flatbread: our waiter recommended this as a vegeatarian option and it was incredibly tasty.  Not on the menu  so the accommodation was greatly appreciated.  \\n- pan roasted salmon: friends thought it was the worst dish of the night\\n- french fries: made with duck fat so vegetarians beware (waiter warned me). \\n\\nnote: that they bring the food out one or two items at a time  and in a specific order. This is tremendously beneficial for people (like myself) who cannot pace themselves while eating. It also really allows you to enjoy the ambience. \\n\\nEntertainment: acts will spill over from the show/bar area next door and into the dining area.  In the time we were there  we witnessed tap dancing twins  fushigi  and a man dressed like a clown playing with metallic rings (creepy).  We also caught some of the burleque/singing happenings in the other room.    \\n\\nAlthough there were some misses (initial arrival situation  some of the food)  the whole experience was quite enjoyable and unique.  2 1/2 hours flew by and all I can remember is laughing  clapping  singing  eating  and drinking to my heart's delight.  All in all  it was money well spent  and I'll surely return the next time I'm in town.\"",

Another friend that was with us said a similar thing happened to her a few weeks earlier when she tried to go with a group of 5 for another bday party.  This type of behavior is completely unacceptable especially for a restaurant/restaurant group of this caliber. If you don't want to take reservations  then fine  but it's poor business to allow patrons to plan a night to fail at your expense.  If you do mess up a reservation  then try to accommodate the customer rather than treating them like they are at fault.  Needless to say  none of my friends will ever be trying this restaurant.

        "text": "\"Let me start this review by saying that there is a lot of really cool stuff in this store. The small store in Downtown Container park is stocked with gorgeous original artwork of pretty much any Disney character you can think of. They also have some really cute figurines and other collectables. If you are a Disney fan  this place really is a must stop. And if you have some money to burn  you might find yourself taking something home.\\n\\nIf you can physically take it home  that is. If you are visiting Las Vegas on vacation  as people are known to do from time to time  and want them to ship a purchase home to you well ... not so much. And here in lies the reason behind me giving out a VERY rare one-star review.\\n\\nAs I was exploring DTCP  I decided to stop in the Disney Fine Art store to look around. It was the day before Valentine's Day  and I thought I might find something here for my wife  who is a huge Disney fan. Most of the store is filled with really cool original paintings ... they're not cheap  but they have some fantastic pieces. I didn't see anything that I felt confident my wife would like  so I was hesitant to pull the trigger on an expensive piece of artwork. But I noticed these cute figurines in the back. They had one that was Kermit and Miss Piggy dining together ... my wife LOVES the Muppets  especially Kermit  so I thought this would be a perfect gift  and was entirely affordable and reasonable at $25. I asked the attendant working if they could ship it to me and she noted that it came in a box that would keep it safe. But I was doing carry-on only and was already tight on space  and I didn't want to risk it being broken  so I paid an extra $8 to have it delivered. I gave them my home address  paid with my credit card  and got a crappy handwritten receipt  plus an e-receipt via Square. \\n\\nAfter a couple of weeks went by I never received either a package  nor a message from the store stating that the package was shipped  with a tracking number provided. I called the store and got a guy who was very nice and apologetic and took my information  said he would look into it  and would call me back immediately with a status update. \\n\\nA couple of weeks pass again  and I've heard nothing. I don't have time to track down things I've already paid for and figure out why they haven't been shipped to me yet  so I wrote it off as a lost cause. But I figured I'd give them another chance. I called again and spoke to a lady who said she was the new store manager and that they had been busy planning a new store opening  and she was just gaining an understanding of what had been done there  etc. I didn't need to hear her story  but she sounded sincere  apologetic  and seemed like someone who had their stuff together. Finally  I thought  I'll be able to get this really cool gift that my wife would LOVE and that I have paid for delivered to me. The lady found my information on file  apologized for it \\\"\"\"\"slipping through the cracks\\\"\"\"\" and would contact me back by close of business with a tracking number.\\n\\nSo guess what happened next? If you guessed nothing ... DING DING DING  you're today's big winner. I waited about 5 days  heard nothing  and filed a dispute for a refund through my credit card company. \\n\\nAgain  let me stress that the merchandise they sell here is fantastic - some really cool stuff. If you live in the Las Vegas area and can buy and take the merchandise home that day - and afford it - you will be happy. But if they can't ship a product I bought onsite  and paid to have shipped  within a month then they should think about making their one store function properly before opening others.\"",

The mint isn't overpowering at all while the lamb is very mild and not gamey at all. \\n\\nChicken tikka: great flavor of spices and peppers and onions. The spiciness was a bit too hot for me but still tasty\\n\\nLamb vindaloo: nicely cooked tender lamb  spicier than the tikka pasty.

The veggies are cooked to perfection without being mushy or too crunchy. The gravy that accompanies it is yummy chicken gravy \\n\\nA bit of salmon: probably my fave so far.  The salmon is moist and not overdone  the potatoes add a perfect balance offsetting the bright flavors of the asparagus  roasted peppers and dill. \\n\\nThe Sticky toffee pudding dessert is gooey sweet salty heaven.

Pin Up Pizza is delicious  fast  convenient  and a good value. While Secret Pizza (Cosmo) and Pop Up (MGM) are good this place is a solid 1 star above.  One slice will easily satisfy you for lunch or a quick dinner. Entrance off the strip or from the PH sports book. Do yourself a favor and stop by next time your in town  this place will definitely steal some of the Earl of Sandwich crowd (and that is very hard to do).",

However  I'll put in my vote for Caesars Palace.\\n\\nI'll start off by saying that originally I had absolutely no desire to get married in Vegas.  I had originally determined that Virginia would be the place for us - it's where we live  it's where we met; the hardest part - finding that special spot not only for the wedding  but for the wedding reception. When I couldn't find anything to my liking  I started thinking that perhaps Vegas wouldn't be so bad (it is after all where he proposed to me).  I had some friends turn me on to Caesars Palace.  Mr. Douglas G helped me set up everything I needed and also put me in contact with others to help me make it an experience I won't forget. \\n\\nGregg and I wanted simple  no fuss and intimate with family and friends.  Caesars had the perfect package - the Bella Luna. Our wedding coordinator  Lindsay was awesome!  She guided me through each step usually with just a form to film out or a question to answer (nice and simple the way I like it).  On the day of the wedding  she called me to make sure I had everything I needed and helped it all go smooth.  The photographer was very professional and took lots of photographs - I can't wait to see them all.   As a venue it was perfect  I could not have asked for anything better!  \\n\\nThanks again to Douglas and Lindsay  but also to Irene P for arranging our Friday night pre-wedding festivities  and Sandra B for arranging our wedding dinner.  Thank you all for making our wedding weekend no stress and perfect!",

        "text": "\"Thank goodness for Ali and The Parlor! I've had so many bad hair experiences that I would go over a year between cuts because the stylists would always cut off way too much or give me horrible layers for my hair type. It was always a cookie cutter cut. \\n  \\nMy 1st visit to The Parlor was impressive. Myself and my daughter were both ready for a change. We were greeted with a smile and very cute sign that welcomed us as new clients. My 13 loved that. Ali was our stylist and she was amazing. She took time to actually ask us real questions about how we maintain our hair  how we prefer to wear it  what styling products we use  and \\\"\"\"\"played\\\"\"\"\" with our hair before even touching the scissors! \\n\\nMy daughter is African American and often times her hair is butchered when we have it cut or she's told she can't have long hair because it won't work. Well  Ali fixed my poor daughters hair that had been horribly botched a year before. Ali made sure to tell her how to keep her hair healthy and even set out a plan to help her to get it to grow out. She was so excited and felt hope instead of defeat for what she couldn't have.\\n\\nNow on to me  after 10 years of non-dyed hair if finally took the plunge! And I love it!!! Ali actually put a color on and started to prep for cutting but wasn't happy with the color and said she wanted it perfect. She did a little change and it was perfect!!! She listened to my past layering complaints and only cut off what was asked and did a beautiful job of making my hair easy to maintain. \\n\\nI've already booked our next appointments and am finally excited about going back the salon!\"",

There was a nice ambiance in the dining area with a guitarist and singer that played light music during our visit. The restaurant was very welcoming and cozy.\\n\\nWe started off with the Dungeness Crab Cake.  They were good!  Not over the top but still good.   This was served with mixed greens   At the same time a bread basket was brought out for the table.  It was just ok.  It was kind of mushed and dry.  For my entree I chose the Pan seared white fish in which the waiter was raving about.   I  can see why...  Delicious and tasty!  The garlic white wine sauce smothered the fish.  The pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied were ok.  I wish there was more of a pesto flavor.  \\n\\nThe service here is impeccable.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The other staff which helped with refills were very polite and accommodating.   \\n\\nOur entire group enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend trying them out! Thanks Bernards!",

My family and I have been going to pho so 1 for years so when I found out  I was super excited. My mom got to the restaurant first and she was waiting outside.  As soon as Khai saw her  he ran out and told her he'd get a table started while she waited for the rest of us to arrive. What awesome service. We felt like VIPs :P\\n\\nNot your typical vietnamese pho place. They have the common pho combos and also offer a variety of other fresh seafood items. I got the oxtail pho. It was ~$12  on the pricey side for pho... but totally worth it. My bowl came out with 3 huge pieces of oxtail! It also comes with a side of dipping sauce for the meat. Mix them up and squeeze a little bit of lemon and its delicious!\\n\\nMy sister got Mi Sate. It came out and looked delicious but it definitely was not. It tasted like someone took half a jar of peanut butter and mixed it in with her soup. Way too peanut-y and sweet. Not a fan.\\n\\nOne other minor complaint I have about this place is that my very Vietnamese mother had a difficult time ordering the specific pho combo she wanted. Their menu had the basics. She typically gets pho chin tai nam... not on the menu. Totally not a problem but when she tried to order  both my mother and the waitresses were confused. Neither of them spoke Vietnamese. I don't mind this at all but I know my mom wasn't too happy. She'd be more comfortable with going to a solely Vietnamese speaking establishment so I probably wont be coming here with my family but I know for sure I will be back with some friends! I really wanna try the Lobster Pho!!!!!",

Kinda gives a feel for a wing house dining setting especially with all the large flat screen TVs located all around the restaurant. Food was delicious. Service was a little bit slow. I felt like the server could have checked on us more often. \\n\\nWe order two appetizers: the fish tacos and pork belly buns. Our tacos came out first  and the buns were still missing. I had to ask the server if it was still coming out because she came to bring our entrees which was the pork chop combination rice plate and I had the shaken steak and egg with tomato rice. So I was a little disappointed the belly buns came out last considering I ordered it as an appetizer. Why is it even an appetizer of it's gonna come out AFTER my entree? that why I'm giving it 4stars verses the 5. Feel like the ball was dropped there.\\n\\nOut of all the items we ordered... All though my shaken steak was great  it wasn't phenomenal. It was a little too oily  although the flavor and taste was great. Even though I will be back for it. I think the one that really stuck out for me... Flavor and taste wise was the fish tacos. I must say it was to be one of the best fish tacos I've had. \\n\\nIt was all good but it was missing a bit of a wow factor for me to give it 5 stars.",

My husband went to pick up food  ordered everything correctly  exactly as he and I wanted it  gladly waited 10 min for the food  drove home and realized there were many things missing...  That ended up being just the beginning of our trouble!  I had the receipt in hand and called asking to speak to a manager. The lady who answered the phone  Carla  said she was the manager  so I told her that we didn't receive items we had paid for  to which she told me she would be glad to give me the items if we came in to get them right then and there. However we live far from the location and my husband was not going to drive all the way back out there. She then told me that was all she could do  that it was company policy there were no other options. I asked if she could take my name and leave a credit of some sort in the office or behind the register  anything other than us driving back out there or just eating the money. To which she said  \\\"\"\"\"no\\\"\"\"\".  That is when I got upset. As a Chicagoan who had been waiting for this restaurant to open  I was beyond disappointed to be treated like this!  She told me there was no proof the burger was missing other than for us to bring all our food  (that we had already unwrapped ) back to the restaurant. So I said  \\\"\"\"\"isn't there an extra burger laying around?\\\"\"\"\"  She instantly replied  \\\"\"\"\"no.\\\"\"\"\"  I then asked for her full name and the phone number to corporate because I was so upset that my husband wasn't going to be able to eat and that as new  potentially loyal customers  we were being treated in this manner.  She then asked me to tell her my ticket number again and read to her word for word what was on my receipt. In other words she assumed I was lying trying to get something for free and needed me to recite the list word for word in order to verify I was telling the truth...  All over a $6 burger!!  Here's a tip  you are a new restaurant in town  make your customers happy even if it means losing $6 down the road rather than arguing back and forth with them for 7 minutes while the food they DO have is getting cold!!  After I did the required song and dance Carla put me on hold and came back telling me she magically discovered there WAS an extra burger at the grill  verifying that when I proposed the idea to her 5 minutes prior she had answered without actually checking!!  At that point she asked for my name and phone number and told me that there would be a note behind the register under my name to give me all the items  in addition to the burger  that were missing for free on my next visit. After all that nonsense I could finally get down to eating the food I had been waiting months for!  The bread on both the hot dogs in our order was stale. Other than that  the hot dogs themselves had a nice snap  the fries were good  probably would have been upgraded to great with the cheese I ordered and paid for and the beef was ok... I will be back to receive our missing items for sure...  As for after that is TBD. Sad first experience!\"",

For $10 (combo) I would say I was very disappointed. I want to support local business but what I ordered doesn't really warrant a return.  There's a lot of great food around this area. ..better step up your game or end up like Donatos. Good luck with everything though   I do wish the best for you so prove me wrong!\"",

I went for a third time this morning because their juice is quite good  and also reasonably priced compared to competitors. After telling my friend about this place  she asked me if I had a punch card with them  it's a pretty good deal: spend $25 and get a free 16oz juice. However this was never offered to me  and I didn't know about it until after I had purchased a few juices. \\n\\nThe reason for the 1 star review is because I walked in this morning before work  and there were two staff members at the register. One staff member was showing the other how to do something on the register  not a problem  I understood this and I'm pretty forgiving  but I was standing there two feet away from them waiting and it was as if I was invisible. I waited some more..........no \\\"\"\"\"Hello \\\"\"\"\" no \\\"\"\"\"We'll be right with you \\\"\"\"\".........no acknowledgment at all. Feeling super awkward and unsure of how long I was going to be ignored for  I turned around  left the store and went to Juby True across the street.\\n\\nI totally understand the need to train someone to do their job  but I think it's common courtesy to at least acknowledge your customers. I'm pretty sure I will not be returning here  as their customer service was non existent this morning.\"",

I am totally an amateur to cycling but from the moment I walked in with questions and bike issues  the staff was incredibly helpful. They never made me feel bad for not knowing what I was doing. They have been so encouraging and their knowledge of all things bike related has already helped me while I'm out on the road. Plus! They're always cheerful no matter how busy it is  and you better believe they are going to go the extra mile (haha pun intended) to make sure your bike is in tip-top shape. Every time I bring my bike in there for something  they're looking it all over  up and down to check parts of the bike I didn't even know existed. Amateur  remember? My point is I really trust their knowledge  honesty  and commitment to the customer. Case in point: I'm writing this because I was just in there and Cindy spent over 20 minutes helping me get my bike fitted to me and didn't even charge me  so I thought i would give back by leaving a good review.

Prior to actually eating here  I had visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for just drinks. The drinks were made well and the prices seemed fair. They have a pretty good selection of wines bottled & on tap. The beers average about $6 but you can get a pitcher for about $12. It's a great deal and even better if you go during happy hour. The bar has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are all very friendly. After a few fun experiences of just hanging out at the bar  I finally actual got a chance to eat here this weekend! It was AMAZING! \\n\\nFirst we started with their soup of the day  Black Bean Sirloin Chili. We ordered a side of bread to go with it so we could all share it as an appetizer.. It was the perfect way to start our meal. Lots of flavor and they don't skimp on the sirloin portions. For dinner I had the Vegetable Platter  my husband had the Half Chicken  my mom had the BBQ Brisket  and my dad had the Short Ribs. The Vegetable platter was shockingly very filling and had tons of flavor. I was afraid I would miss eating meat for dinner  but I ended up not missing it at all. It was perfect! The kale had a great garlicky flavor and the tomatoes and blue cheese mix is now one of my favorite flavor combinations that I'm definitely going to try to mimic at home. I got to taste a bite of all the dishes my family ordered too had they were all great. The chicken was super moist and had a slight sweetness in flavor. The ribs & brisket were both tender and booming with flavor as well. \\n\\nWhere this restaurants loses a star is because of the sides. Aside from my vegetable platter  All the other side dishes were really lacking in flavor and added nothing the main course. The grits seemed a little mushy and didn't have the flavor your would expect from the Jalepeno. The orzo was just average too. In fact  everyone cleaned their plates of the meats but no one really touched their sides. They kept eating the kale and tomatoes off my plate. The next time I go  I might ask if I can get the kale with my main course instead of the grits or orzo.\\n\\nOverall I loved it here. I can't wait for a chance to go back and so excited to have a new place in the neighbor I can stumble home from.\"",

It turns out that the chefs at Jjanga (not that game Jenga) used to work at that Hendo joint  so now I don't have to go all that way to get my fix.  This place is new and was not that busy  which was just fine with us on this Hallmark holiday-no waiting for a table.  Very nice modern decor with wood accenting and quite roomy  this place doesn't feel like your traditional sushi restaurant.  Jung  our waiter du jour  was very friendly and attentive  making sure he answered any questions we had and kept the food and drinks coming.\\nIn addition to the Lion Roll  I liked the pumpkin soup  the Johnny Roll  and dessert  of course. Jjanga had a  Valentine's Day special: fried banana with vanilla ice cream  whipped cream  and chocolate sauce  a sweet ending to a great V Day meal. Jung even took our  picture with some new-fangled Polaroid type camera so they could hang our photo on one of the walls  posted with those of other customers. We got one to keep  as well.

The wonderful food  ambiance  and wide variety of burgers leaves me wanting to come back. \\n\\nPrice - $9.50 for all burger styles and no extra cost for turkey burger or chicken breast and you can get the burger \\\"\"\"\"crunchified\\\"\"\"\" for no extra cost. The shakes are pricier at $6.50 and seemed slightly smaller than normal shake sizes. Sweet potato fries are $4  but feed two people. We got 2 burgers  2 shakes  and 1 fry for $38  plus a small optional tip at the counter and table. \\n\\nFood - BBP offers a wide variety of burger options. The two we tried (Carolina and the classic) were amazing. What was most notable was how ideally cooked they were. They allow you to select from rare to well done. The sesame buns held the burgers and toppings together making it very easy to eat without the loss of any toppings. The  shakes were some of the most flavorful we've had. It is apparent that BBP is using the $6.50 to invest in quality ingredients and not skimping on them. Our coconut shake and pistachio malt were achievements in subtlety and over the top flavor  respectively. You could chew the flakes of coconut...mmmm. The sweet potato fries served two people and came with horseradish based dipping sauces. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had flakes of mild salt coating them. \\n\\nAmbiance - There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor dining area is large and very modern and funky. There is S-shaped counter-style seating that zig zags across one side of the room. You can see through a wide openings to where they are preparing the good. The vibe is casual  but is fun to look. \\n\\nService - The service was efficient and friendly. The person who took our order at the counter made sure to guide us through our order and offered complementary water cups. The food was brought to us quite quickly. For being informal  fast-service dining  the service was very attentive checking in on us and the food.\\n\\nIt's clear that the sincerity of this place goes far beyond slapping a celebrity chef's name on the shingle.\"",

Free parking!\\n\\nSECOND: The downsides myself and group experienced: Long wait time to check in  took 30+ minutes  and the check-in lady was very dry. Interior on many floors such as hallways are disgusting. There weren't any ice machines available to us. The pillows were either extremely lumpy  uneven  or hard as a rock. The rooms smelled like sewage. The ceiling was starting to cave in-in the rooms. The water in the bathroom would either stay cold or get extremely hot. The hinge to pull for shower faucet was broken in the room so couldn't use shower. The tub drain is clogged. The hair dryer in the room sparked and popped in my face twice and then stopped working.

I refused to just stand in the humungous line of over 300 people  so instead I went sight seeing with friends who were staying at a normal hotel across the street. Guess this is what I get for being cheap! Although the rooms were really inexpensive  I would have paid to leave this place. \\n\\nMy other big complaint was their parking garage. It is a giant nonsensical mess of pillars  with no signs directing which way to go. Cars weave every which way  some going the wrong way and almost causing head on collisions. It took me almost half an hour just to cross Las Vegas Blvd to get to the garage portion. Then I had to follow a huge maze  dodging pillars and pedestrians  before finally finding parking. \\n\\nOnce I FINALLY got to my room at 4am  I found that it was decent. It was up on a higher level with a partial strip view  and I think the carpeting was new. The bed was very comfortable  and the room had a small balcony. They upgraded me to this \\\"\"\"\"VIP\\\"\"\"\" room after losing my original reservation. Thank god  because if this was for VIPs  I can't even imagine what a regular room would've looked like! It was very basic  but at least clean. That's more than I can say for the rest of this casino. \\n\\nAt the lobby  gift shop areas  and check in desk  the carpeting was absolutely filthy. The entire property stunk of rancid cigarette smoke  as did the clientele. Everyone walking around in the place looked like bums or out of work hookers. There were a few average joes like me roaming around  who looked absolutely horrified at their surroundings. \\n\\nChecking out was another fiasco. Their easy checkout on the TV wasn't working  and the phone system to reach someone at the front desk takes about as long as checking in  so I finally resorted to waiting in line downstairs.

Groups of 18-24 year olds stood out there screaming \\\"\"\"\"wooo hoo\\\"\"\"\"  and \\\"\"\"\"show us your t!ts\\\"\"\"\" to people across The Quad from 6:30-7:30 p.m. (when I left) and were still at it when I returned to the room at 4:00a.m. and it continued until I gave up and got up at 7:30a.m.\\n\\nThe room was dirty  the carpets were stained  the bathroom hadn't been mopped (proven with a quick wipe with a damp washcloth)  the place smelled bad.\\nOn a good note. The beds and pillows were new and very comfortable! \\n\\nThe rooms facing the strip are above the \\\"\"\"\"nightclub\\\"\"\"\" which blasts music until 4:00 a.m. with no reprieve  so it's not any quieter on the other side of the building.  \\n\\nThis former Imperial Palace looks beyond repair.  I recommend moving on  even if you have to pay a little more.  It's worth it for a clean comfortable room that you can enjoy for the short time you're in your room or just sleeping off a late night. The rooms at Planet Hollywood were clean  comfortable and nicely decorated.  Go there instead. I wish I had!\"",

When we first got there  around 11pm  we stood in line for 45 minutes waiting to be checked in. After that we got lost in a labyrinth of hallways and elevators  we finally found the elevator to our floor that was basically in the basement. The elevator smelled like cat urine and dirty diapers  our floor smelled even worse. When we opened the door to our room we noticed lewd drawings on the walls  cockroaches  stains everywhere. It basically looked and smelled like a hooker had been murdered there  recently. We obviously immediately decided that we could not stay there  so we called the front desk. I was on hold for 30 minutes until we decided to walk back up to the front desk and talk to someone in person. The lady seemed unfazed at our assessment of the room and told us that floor hadn't been renovated in twelve years. We got \\\"\"\"\"upgraded\\\"\"\"\" to a different room that still smelled and had stains  but it was an improvement. I had brought pool cues with me  because I was there for the 2013 APA Nationals. The next night we fell asleep (we were sober)  and upon waking up realized that my pool cues  and another girl's luggage  were gone. Which means that someone came into our room while we were sleeping and stole them. We called hotel security to file a report and he also seemed unfazed at this occurrence. \\\"\"\"\"This happens all the time \\\"\"\"\" he told me. He also said \\\"\"\"\"The casino only cares about one thing -the casino \\\"\"\"\" and \\\"\"\"\"chalk it up as a loss.\\\"\"\"\" We noticed the front door to our room did not latch properly unless you slammed it shut  apparently it is not uncommon for thieves to roam the hallways and push on doors and steal from the ones ajar. They did not have cameras in the hallways  and were unwilling to look at footage from the video they did have. When no one seemed willing to help me in any way  I spoke with a manager. I did get a little emotional during our conversation  because there was some creep in our room while three helpless young women slept. We could have been raped or murdered  he could of done whatever he wanted  and no one at The Quad seemed to care. I told the manager I was not staying in an unsafe room and we were once again moved but he still would not do anything about our stolen belongings. After that my vacation was basically ruined  as one can imagine. To anyone reading this  I beg you not to stay at The Quad. It is unsafe  the staff is unhelpful and \\\"\"\"\"doesn't care about you\\\"\"\"\" - direct quote from staff member. I will be calling a lawyer and I plan on suing. I am also calling every media outlet in LV so that everyone is aware of how scary and unsafe this place is. The building needs to be condemned  not renovated.\"",

Our check-in receptionist was very professional and courteous. Great blackout curtains.

It was like an equally greasy  but not as crispy version of Pizza Hut pan pizza. \\n\\nThey're really generous with the cheese  but stingy as hell with the toppings. This 2nd location recently opened  but don't believe the older pics from the Arville location or their online menu pics  it's super misleading. What they show on one slice is about what you get on half the pizza. The Guinea pie had MAYBE half a meatball on the entire thing  but was loaded with ricotta  mozzarella and spinach. Really dumb because the meatball is cheaper than the cheeses. The moisture from all that spinach also made the crust really soggy. The Guinea sounded awesome  but wasn't. The garlic white sauce also was extremely bland. \\n\\nBack Home was a little better - crust was super crispy in the beginning  but soggy after the first piece. Again  really generous with cheese  and short on sausage and pepperoni. It was better than the Guinea  but still not very good - soggy pretty quickly and literally dripping with grease. \\n\\nService was great even though there was only 1 person doing the counter  phone orders and playing waitress. She was sweet and attentive. \\n\\nAlso their tables are ridiculously small. Do not sit at a 2 top because the pizza pan takes up basically the entire table. They need to invest in the stands that most other pizza places have. \\n\\nI would return for take out on poutine and to try their loaded fries  and maybe the sandwiches. But I am not at all a fan of their pizza. I'd recommend this place if you're with a group and looking for value  but keep in mind that you're only filling up on bread and grease. I'd rather pay more for a smaller  better quality pizza.",

It has a maple top filling with bacon bits on top.  I didn't care for the top filling of the doughnut  but the bacon bits make it work.  Still wasn't bad  just wasn't my favorite out of the ones I tried.\\nWhat-A- Joy  it's very chocolaty - which nothing is wrong with that just makes it all the better :). This was my co-worker's favorite. I believe this is made to mock the Almond Joy candy...well not mock but to mimic.  I don't like coconut usually but this surprisingly good.  \\n I LOVE the smores...it tastes like smores.  It has a marshmallow filling that is soooo yummy  I had to dip some of the What-A-joy donuts in there because I like the filling.  Probably will get another one next time I stop by.  \\nApple Fritter- this was the least sweet out of the ones I tried.  Still good  I didn't taste chucks of apples or anything...I've never had this kind of donut before so wasn't sure how it's supposed to taste but it's a little sweet like some cinnamon but wasn't overwhelming.\\nThe Raspberry filled donuts is just like your regular filled donuts.  Looks like they use real preservatives though because I see the seeds in the filling of the donuts.  Yum.  It's sugar coated instead of glazed as some places make their jelly filled.  \\n\\nDefinitely worth checking it out.  I tried mostly their Gourmet Doughnuts.  The two that weren't were the What-A-Joy and raspberry filled.  \\n\\nThe location was in a gas station which I felt was a little old  but it works.  It seems clean..

My friend had to order an extra shot of tequila for her margarita on the rocks. No thank you. When we got the bill  we found out that our husbands' Jameson on the rocks were $21 per glass.

Not only that but I had a nice conversation with one before I was seated. At first glance the menu is pretty standard bar food but many of the items and food combinations I never saw before so naturally I was impressed. In all honesty the best part of my night out at Twin Peaks was my server. She sat down at my table and talked to me about the food and drinks in a very friendly (once again not a creepy friendly way either) and we had a very good conversation where I really got to know her and she got to know me. What I noticed was all the servers behaved the same way and to me good server customer relations are always a great sign. In all honestly what really made my night was how welcomed I felt and to me being greeted with genuine warm hospitality is always a plus (not to mention everything on the menu is very reasonably priced and you really get the bang for your buck). Another thing I absolutely loved was the kind of music that Twin Peaks has. Silly I know but that's another thing I look for in a good restaurant. One other thing I should point out is the great merchandise available to purchase. Not only do you have the choice of shirts and baseball hats but also a really nice and functional winter cap (I plan on buying one next time I come in) Now my one and only complaint is there's dozens of televisions but they all have the exact same thing on. To me that's pretty redundant and if I was actually interested in eating out or sitting at a bar and needed to keep up with a sports game this would be a huge flaw (luckily I'm not that kind of person). All in all it was a very good experience and I ended up coming back again not that long after. Honestly I'll probably make it a weekly ritual and that to me is a true sign of a good place to go to.

There is not standing at the bar  or around the tables.\\n2. If you have a party more than 4  and you want to split a check per what you ordered  this will not be accommodated.  You will have to split it evenly.  This got very awkward for my group of friends because we all ordered very different things.  Luckily some of our party had cash so the four of us that didn't could pay for what we bought.\\n3. They do not take reservations between 4 and 8pm\\n4. There is a $10 minimum for a card charge  but luckily the drinks are $9-11 dollars  so you should be ok.\\n\\nI've been here twice.  Once was on a Thursday around 7pm.  We were told we couldn't have a reservation till after 8.  When I arrived at 7  the place was empty and luckily they sat us.  The second time was last Saturday (labor day weekend) and we were told it was a 2 hour wait for a cocktail... not dinner... so we went to another bar in cityscape.\\n\\nSo the first time I was able to actually get in was ok.  The drink menu is fun.  Tons of options and there was a fantastic graph on the back to help guide you if you wanted something exciting  sweet  traditional  or savory.  My cocktails were great  no complaints.  I was really excited to have a fun  new  cocktail place in phoenix so things were looking up.\\n\\nThe food menu has some left to be desired  but if you treat this as a place to get a drink vs. getting dinner  then you'll be fine.  The food was good though  just not a great variety. \\n1.  I had the patte with bread  very yummy.\\n2.  The Ramen Burger... well that was disappointing.  Yes  it says that there is a lot of sauce on it (\\\"\"\"\"extra napkins\\\"\"\"\")  but it really did over power the burger.  I could barely taste the beef or the ramen... really they acted like conduits for the sauce which wasn't that memorable.  \\n3. My plain fries  a side that is separate  were really good.  I would like to have a cocktail and these fries every time I come here.\\n3.  The loaded friends looked really good and my friends enjoyed them\\n\\nWe all liked being there  and I wanted to go back and introduce other friends to bitter and twisted (hence last Saturday) but they just make it too hard.  Also considering there is the blue hound  arrogant butcher and squid ink in walking distance (all have great cocktails and food).\\n\\nI will try to come back again  I just hope they accommodate customers a little better.\"",

Visited on a Sunday afternoon  well after any lunch rush.  Seated straight away  took a bit for the server to get there.  He was friendly but weird.  We were one of 4 tables seated.  I ordered the 2 meat combo  brisket and sausage.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food.  The thing with barbecue is that it's already cooked  because it takes hours to do so - how could it possibly take that long to plate some things that were nearly or fully ready to plate and serve.  The brisket was AWFUL.  The worst it could be without being legitimately inedible.  \\\"\"\"\"Dry\\\"\"\"\" and \\\"\"\"\"unseasoned\\\"\"\"\" are understatements.  The portion size was absurd.  Probably 2.5 oz.  The tiny piece of sausage (less than half a link) was itself halved and burnt onto a flat top grill before serving.  This is not a snack bar at the beach  this is a restaurant charging $15 for a plate.  The cole slaw was bad.  Beans were ok.  I asked if it came with sliced bread  and the server said Texas toast.  Actually  it was a cut up buttered hoagie roll.  huh???\\n\\nMy dining companions enjoyed their pulled pork and combo sandwiches.  They did bring out more awful brisket  comp the drinks  and take off $5 from the bill.  So they were apologetic about it... \\n\\nIn the end it was the worst brisket I have ever eaten at a place calling itself a BBQ restaurant  the smoked sausage was awful  and it took FOREVER.  For me  this place got zero stars for food  0.5 stars for service  and the rest for being responsive to my displeasure.  If you have to go  try the pulled pork maybe.  I am never coming back.\"",

Both a slice of heaven! Both had such great flavor. I enjoyed the Funghi because I loved all the garlic and my friends loved the Diavlo because of the hot sausage. We all agreed we would get again.. but not until after we tried others; they have to all be just as good! Unfortunately  we were all to full to get dessert. At the end of the evening our bill was a pleasant surprise! Not any different from the 4 of us going to any other restaurant  but the quality of the meal was way better so we feel we got our moneys worth and some. I highly suggest this place and am sure you will all enjoy",

It also came with a fried egg on top and 2-3 small pieces of sweet plantains. \\n\\nI almost always leave great reviews and if I dont like something I just dont go back but this place really rubbed me the wrong way. I felt like I was paying extremely high prices for mediocre food. They really nickel and dime you and they have no shame in letting you know.

I am a huge supporter for small businesses and will pay high prices for high quality food  but I will never spend my money here again. I counted and literally had 3 small strips of meat on my plate while everything else was tomatoes and onions which was shocking after seeing the pictures on yelp. I know they recently raised their prices so I dont know if they recently have gotten cheaper with the food quantity also. In total we spent $40.00 and were furious.",

The meat in the sandwiches was moist and tender. The buns were fresh. Once you got to the bottom of the coleslaw container it was actually quite good. My roast potatoes were ok (quite bland though) and partner's fries were good. The BBQ dipping sauce was quite nice.\\nThe Bad: The mushroom condiment was so peppery as to be off-putting. The onion condiment was relatively tasteless. All the other condiments were either too vinegary or peppers. Partner had to add quite a bit of Tabasco to the wings even though the hottest sauce was asked for. I asked for \\\"\"\"\"a little bit\\\"\"\"\" of sauce  but the counter-person slathered my bun with it. The coleslaw is served in pre-prepared plastic cups and  therefore  the top part was dry and flavourless. My roast potatoes really needed the BBQ dipping sauce to taste like much. The only dessert available was individually plastic boxed slices of a \\\"\"\"\"lemon pie\\\"\"\"\" with no meringue but a factory piped \\\"\"\"\"cream\\\"\"\"\" top that took me 3 forkfuls before I could taste any lemon flavour. Only water available is 1 type of bottled water.\\nThe Ugly: The 3rd thing they promise is no \\\"\"\"\"friture\\\"\"\"\". If french fries aren't fried then what are they? Seriously people; get it together. \\nOnly 1 of the 3 staff seemed to know what was going on and that one didn't look like she cared. Also  she started preparing my partner's order before even taking mine (or acknowledging my presence) even though we standing at the counter side by side. \\nExcept for 2 uncomfortable benches that are right in front of the ordering counter that can seat 5 at most  the other 25 seats in the place are all extra tall wooden chairs. For short folk like me it's a nightmare and the tall chairs tend to wobble if you are a person of size. There are hanging lamps right in front of the menu board that make it difficult to see  and the design of the place  in general  is a hot mess - way too crowded.\\nThe Downright Disastrous: The noise! The vent was on full blast right over the noisy refrigerator with both the radio and the TV going. (Why a TV way up in a corner in a 30 seat place? Is it for the staff?) Sitting near that vent was also a freezing experience I will never want to repeat. We could barely hear our own conversation. Great for getting people to leave quickly. And the name Rotisserie? For a busy Saturday night I saw 1(count 'em) sad looking little rotisserie chicken on the prep counter. All the other meat is in and under fancy cloche servers that I would expect to see at the Ritz. You cannot see the meat you are ordering. Not a good sign.\\nI may give this place one more chance but I really doubt it with so many other excellent places to go for this type of cuisine and  especially for rotisserie chicken.\"",

THATS GOTTA BE what we will try ! \\n\\nLamb Sticks - $5.95 for 8 skewers - We tried the spicy and the medium. Spicy was first. Meat was kind of small. Flavor wise  DELICIOUS ! Spicy and flavorful. Cumin  pepper  and i believe lemon grass as well? Yummy ! Priced good too ! Medium level was actually a bit disappointing. It was quite the huge gap in spice level between medium and spicy. You can call the spicy  on a scale of 1-10  maybe an 8. Medium  3-4. It wasn't spicy. It was actually sweet to me. Doriee had called it teriyaki lamb. XD \\n\\nBeef Sticks - $4.95 for 8 skewers - Spicy level as well. Same seasoning as the lamb skewers. Was a little awkward because usually the cumin spice is used for lamb. Was still good. Spicy like the spicy lamb too. Meat amount was more than then lamb. \\n\\nHot Pot Combo - $11.95 for 20 sticks with up to 4 different items - We had ordered shrimp  fried tofu  king oyster mushroom  and beef tendon balls. \\n\\nShrimp - Cooked perfectly. Kind of flavorless. Some people had called this place the sichuan hot n juicy. No where near it. None of the sauce stuck. Even peeling the shell and dipping back into sauce didnt help. The Hot Pot \\\"\"\"\"soup\\\"\"\"\" is too thin for that application. \\n\\nKing Oyster Mushroom - Good texture as this mushroom known to be. Slides OFF the skewer very easily... so you'll have to go caveman spear pokin for it later or just use two skewers and go chopsticks style. \\n\\nBeef Tendon Balls - Cut into maybe 1/8 slivers ? Holds the soup flavor pretty well. Seemed to have nicely absorbed into the slivers. \\n\\nFried Tofu - Lol. I had called this \\\"\"\"\"the item to screw thy self with\\\"\"\"\"... Fried tofu tends to be VERY porous and is KNOWN to soak up ANYTHING you put it in thats liquid. Spicy hot pot soup and a sponge of a tofu? Yep... XD Holds a LOT of soup in each piece. Tends to dribble down your chin too so be CAREFUL to not get it on yourself and be VERY careful cuz it will \\\"\"\"\"explode\\\"\"\"\" when you bite into it :P \\n\\nOverall  the lamb skewers were delicious. Beef was ok. Hot pot combo  im pretty sure the soup base is the same one i use for hot pot at home ... Lol flavor was VERY VERY similar...

When the job was done  he gave me a call and asked if I could pick up the car. I couldn't and when he heard that  he offered to drive my car to my house! What amazing customer service. Courteney is friendly and did a great job. I would definitely recommend him to friends and for future stereo install. Thanks bud!",

First of all they don't have fountain drinks so  our drinks were from a can or plastic bottle. We  got the spicy pork (lunch) for $9.99  it was bland  lettuce wrap $5.99 but didn't get the chilli peppers  and 2 spicy tuna rolls. At first our waitress only put in for 1 order so we had to wait. The rolls were big and fat for $4.50 and worth the price. I love it when the tuna is still cold and the rice is slightly warm. That's the only thing that save Gogi from 1 star.  The spicy tuna was the BEST thing here.  I would ONLY come back for that.",

Great choice of craft beers  the chicken wings rocked as a starter but then came the main. \\n\\nI realised too late that I hadn't been asked how I wanted my burger cooked and unfortunately then got the dish I expected. \\n\\nOver cooked  well done  dry  lacking depth of flavour. I LOVE my burgers and had hunted out the best on our trip. This was sadly the worst we had. Also it seemed strange that the burger listed along the lines of the ultimate bowl burger came without cheese or bacon for which you had to pay extra on the $16 or so price tag. If it's the deluxe venue burger pimp it up guys!\\n\\nTo top matters off my wife's chicken burger was made from chicken mince and not breast. She had one bite  said it was cold and didn't touch anymore. With such a cool venue  rock ethos  friendly staff and great beer menu we expected food to match - maybe a bad day in the kitchen but it sadly reminded us of cheap chain pub food in the uk - not fresh  lacking care and definitely a sad end to our beer and food tour that had so many highlights.",

I always say you can trust a place w/ PBR on tap and my rule has yet to let me down lol They get some of the best shows in town and their tickets are reasonably priced (I heard locals get 2 4 1 tix if bought at the box office but always forget to ask). Combining bowling  fried chicken and live music is an interesting concept but seems to work considering this isn't their 1st rodeo w/ locations in NY and somewhere else. After many visits we broke down and tried the fried chicken (how could you not?). It was quite tasty. Not the cheapest fried chicken prices but I get it. Worth it  especially if you're already there watching or waiting for your band. \\n The bowling is cool too. I heard there are like 30 lanes in there but don't know where they're hiding them all. A cool feature is if you get a lane while a concert is going on they broadcast a live feed on the big screens that sit above the end of each lane  looks cool. If you forget to wear shes w/ socks you can score a pair but they'll run ya like $6 (ouch!).\\n\\nThey have a decent draft selection w/ both PBR & Stella making the cut and being somewhat affordable  so kudos to that. PBR weighing in at $6 and all other beers I think are $7. Mixed wells drinks will run you $12. Their gried chicken (what they're known for) is pricey as fux but equally as good. 8 piece of dark will run ya $24  $26 for mixed & $28 for all white. They have the shoe string fries and for $4 they're worth it. I saw calamari on the menu and we were hella tempted but had already ordered all that other goodness and for $14.50 was too much for us to add to the tab. C'mon  we need room for drinks too.",

The whole reason I go into an anime store is to collect discs of my favorite titles or discover new ones. An anime store that does not stock anime DVDs is like Pizza Hut deciding they are not going to sell pizza anymore. They also do not carry any actual video games (it is not clear if they intend to stock any of this material in the future  but if they are not  they need to reconsider.)\\n\\nThey do have some cool memorabilia (cosplay props  household items  keychains  collectables  figures  etc.)  but nearly all of it is severely overpriced.

He then told us to do the math and write down what we want to go to each card. After seeing we were getting pretty upset our server came over and said this is how it's always been and that it even says it on the menu  but we never got menus or told that they don't spit tabs. Then she also had the nerve to tell us that the manager was making an exception for us. I guess having us split up our own checks for them is making an exception for us.

I felt bad for her  because it was such an awkward thing to have to tell someone. I wondered what would happen if I refused... would they kick me out? They lost any future business from me right there and then anyway. Its not like it was busy either  there was one other table occupied. \\n\\nThen I was told that me and my three friends couldn't share a hookah  we had to pay for two  even if sharing only one.\\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"Oh but we don't have menus\\\"\"\"\" so here have an awkward moment using my point of sale app on my iPad so you can decide a flavor  because we don't want to spend the money to print a list of flavors. \\n\\nThe thing was  I wasn't looking for a bargain. I really wasn't concerned about the price. But by being forced to buy multiple hookahs and forced to buy a drink it made the experience very negative  despite the fact that I would have purchased those things anyway. \\n\\nOtherwise the service was good  but I mean there was no one else there so I can't give them too much credit. And the hookah was sub par. The vent on the hookah was clogged (this is something you would only notice if you have a lot of experience with hookahs) meaning you can't clear the jar of smoke and it doesn't hit efficiently. This is a sign that they don't maintain them very well. This was the case on both of the hookahs we ordered. I had to open the valves myself and clean out the bearings there so we could vent our hookahs properly. When I worked at a hookah lounge we would replace your hookah if the valve was not working properly. \\n\\nThe server insisted I smoked from a piece of fruit instead of a ceramic head. After telling her \\\"\"\"\"no\\\"\"\"\" more than once I finally submitted  and as I expected the fruit provided less smoke than a ceramic head. I imagine they use some cheap tobacco that burns up really quick  so they push the fruit to make it last longer. It does last longer  but at the expense of good and heavy smoke. \\n\\nMY ADVICE TO THE MANAGEMENT: Instead of trying to squeeze every penny out of your customers in order to raise your average sale  try to provide great experiences. By the lack of customers on a Friday night  I'm guessing your current methods aren't working very well!\"",

I've only experienced it once but it did ruin my shaved ice that day. It was probably a one off but enough to bring down my review.",

He is a super nice kid and speaks fluent English so the language barrier's gone. Yay Kevin! Kevin explained to me that they updated a few of their congee recipes to be less watery - they read their yelp reviews and take them pretty seriously. \\n\\nThey also added some buns to their menu. We tried the marinated beef one and the filling inside shocked me at how good it was. It tasted like it could be a dish on its own that people would order. One thing that deters me from buns is the soggy bottom that you sometimes get from steaming them and they don't have this at all! The dough is obviously handmade and tastes different from the super sweet buns you'd get in the frozen aisle. A pleasant change - it feels like you're eating real food. Even their homemade chili oil is amazing  I just want to smother everything in it. A little tip: their dumplings and congee are surprisingly good for a hangover.\\n\\nOverall  I'm really glad there's a place for more wholesome options in the plaza. The walls are now adorned with plaques that tell you about the ingredients and preparation methods they use in their dishes  which reinforces that they strive for healthy but delicious food. I can't wait for school to start so I can go back again. And if you do go  say hi to Kevin :)",

I settled on a raspberry cupcake as the sign said it was a seasonal favorite while my daughter ordered their specialty red velvet cupcake and we also tried their mini chocolate marshmallow for $2.00.\\n\\nThe chocolate marshmallow cupcake was horrible.  Neither my daughter nor I could finish it and it tasted like a rum based dark chocolate topping with a strong bitterness.  \\n\\nThe raspberry cupcake was overly sweet but definitely tasted like fresh raspberries were used in the making of the frosting.  I could only handle a small bite of it due to the sweetness.  Unfortunately the cupcake was not moist inside and rather crumbly.  It tasted stale or store bought instead of handmade.   The red velvet cupcake was only slightly moister but when I picked it up  the top came off and the cupcake fell to the ground.  I am all for cupcake tops but this only happens with dry cupcakes. The flavor on the red velvet cupcake was good and this is the only one of the three I would ever try again.",

Not to mention the globs of Mayo they add to these sandwiches and the soggy shredded lettuce and store bought tasting guacamole they put on the Beach Club. Pretty cheap for an expensive sandwich. DISGUST. The owners I believe  a tall guy with green eyes is always touching his nose and his obscenely tan shorter comrade are both very snooty and stuck up. The tan one less so  he seemed a little friendlier. And then the African American kid with braces that claims to be the manager that hates his job? I could literally die.

        "text": "\"After eating Jimmy Johns subs literally almost every other day sometimes every day for 3 months. I can tell you with great confidence that their sandwiches are meh. That's right meh. Now the service I've never had any issues with but what I do not like is that one I go in to order my preferred sub which is a turkey Tom in order to get a decent sandwich it's necessary to get extra turkey. Then I also like cheese on sandwich and that's extra too. Say what you will about the bread it's OK.  Sometimes the bread seems old so the bread is hit and miss for what is advertised as gourmet hence everything a la carte. \\n\\nSo after I get my Turkey Tom just the way like it. It's running me  hold your breath over $8. I think 8.64 to be exact for a sandwich that is like 8-9 inches. Now the extra meat isn't like a ton of meat because regular meat is laughably miniscule. Now the sandwich  it's  ok as described it above they are \\\"\"\"\"meh\\\"\"\"\"  especially with the gourmet tagline and the advertised low prices which go up quickly to get a respectable sandwich that will fill you up. Add a drink and chips and I've gone over the ten dollar clip. If you're hungry you will need the chips so you better get those. \\n\\nNow like I mentioned earlier in this review I ate at this Jimmy Johns like every other day for 3 months. Why? Because they are 30 seconds from where I work. That is it that's the only reason why. Never once have ever been blown away by their sandwiches. Just annoyed that I have to get extra meat. \\n\\nSo unless you absolutely love Jimmy Johns do yourself a huge favor and go to Port of Subs (not Subway never Subway) where you will not need extra meat and your sandwich will be better. Oh and the cheese comes with the sandwich also. Oh and its going to seem like twice the food. \\n\\nOne last thing I do not like about this place is the crazy delivery culture that their subs are freaky fast or so fast you'll freak. The Jimmy John management must be forcing their drivers to drive un safely fast through the parking lot. Then I see the driver get out of his vehicle and just start sprinting through the lot to get his next order. What's up with that? . Do you think we don't notice how un safe your delivery practices are? \\n\\nSo in conclusion yes I will still eat at Jimmy Johns but only for the convenience.  But I Will not eat here as regularly any longer.\"",

Seriously  when this place is closed soon  I will not be surprised.\\n\\nThe first warning sign:  There were only 4 customers in the entire restaurant when we walked in.  There were 11 people behind the counter working.  It was weird... they were all kind of just standing around  and a few of them were just watching others work.  Restaurants that aren't busy (and are empty) are usually like that for a reason.  We soon learned why.\\n\\nThe pizza I ordered was a pepperoni  olive & pineapple.  The woman making it was nice  but I have to admit the pizza didn't even look all that great when it was being made.  She used very few ingredients  it seemed.  For roughly $15 for a personal size pizza  it seemed average at best while it was being made.\\n\\nI got to the cash register to pay  and a new cashier was being trained that day.  It took quite a bit longer than I expected.  As I looked around  I'm thinking now that maybe even the cooks and prep people were being trained as well.  There were what appeared to be a few managers just standing around watching them like a hawk.  It was odd.  Three months into a new restaurant  I would've expected things to be running smoother.\\n\\nThe pizza arrived.  The edges were black on the crust and I like them that way.  However  a closer glance revealed that the entire interior of the pizza was either undercooked or uncooked.  Picking up the first slice  it was clear that the thing was a complete mess.  The entire pizza toppings slid off  including cheese and everything.  I was left holding a wet piece of literally uncooked dough with some tomato sauce.  It was a rubbery mess and the entire middle of the pizza was drowned in wetness and was more of a soup than a pizza!  The whole thing was gooey  wet and runny.  The crust was so thin and undone that it was a drooping disaster.  Each slice was like that:  watery  dripping  and unable to even stand up like a normal pizza slice.  \\n\\nIt was inedible.  Before I left  I scooped some of the soup-like toppings on a fork  and it didn't even taste good.  The crust had no flavor at all.  I will never be back  and would implore anyone reading this to think twice about ever stepping foot in this place.  There's a reason it ended up on one of the lower-end Vegas properties like Monte Carlo rather than someplace like the Cosmopolitan  Aria or Caesar's Palace.\\n\\nEat at this place at your own peril.

None.\\n\\nCan you believe I had a nightmare last night because his food was such a total disappointment?

I wish the same could be said about the food. :x\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I tried \\\"\"\"\"The Ultimate Asian Chicken Wraps\\\"\"\"\" ($13) - The portion on this one was horrendous  tiny bits of food here and there. But I would forgive them  if the food was actually fantastic. I can quickly recommend the Yard House and Cheesecake Factory for having better asian lettuce wraps - They have better portions  tastier meats and extremely complex and flavorful sauces in their versions. The sauces here were very simple - Peanut  sweet and sour  sweet soy. If I could tell each ingredient immediately right off the bat  that makes for an amateur sauce  if you ask me (the sauce queen.) The chicken sate skewers tasted identical to the Thai and Chinese restaurants in the mall's food court that offer you samples on toothpicks. Yeah it's moist  but it also lacks the finesse and flavor that you would come to expect from the Mayor of Flavortown. The Chinese minced chicken was beyond salt bombed. That's all we tasted  salt. It's funny to me that the idea of \\\"\"\"\"Asian\\\"\"\"\" inspired is to douse everything with soy sauce. Lol. Hey  there's more to asian flavors than just salty soy sauce. \\n\\nWe also shared the \\\"\"\"\"Big Dipper Sandwich\\\"\"\"\" ($17) - The roast beef was bland  chewy  hard and dry. The fries were dried out and rock hard - they've been sitting on a heating rack  that's for sure. It's upsetting that they couldn't even manage to dish out freshly fried to order fries. The bread roll was hard and plain - where's the toasted garlic torpedo roll that was advertised? Definitely didn't taste any garlic. I also didn't taste the creamy horseradish sauce and the au jus?! Ha. Let's just say it tasted like worcestershire sauce and water. I dunked my sandwich and I didn't taste any richness  any soul  any flavor! I see a rosemary garnish but no rosemary flavor? Weird. The lovely (random) ladies next to us from Pennsylvania ordered the same and they were highly disappointed as well.

There was no wait when we got there on a Saturday night around 9:30pm. It was a cool setting. I liked the decorations and the menus  however it was a bit cramped. The waiter was friendly and took our drink order  we like to order appetizers  but the selection was very limited so we just decided to order our dinners. We both ordered the Mac-n-cheese burger which also comes with fries. It took about 20-30 minutes for our food to come so it wasn't too long of a wait. I was super excited to try this burger  recommended by the hostess. I was not impressed. The burger was a good size but for being a Mac-n-cheese burger you could hardly taste any cheese. I was a little disappointed. It was cool they the burger came with a side of 4 different types of fries  however they were COATED with seasoning making them really hard to eat. All I tasted when I ate them was the chili pepper salt mix that was covering them. I love food network and Guy's show  but I was sadly disappointed with the quality of the food. I thought for $20 I would get a little better burger than it was. Most likely won't go back  which I'm sad about because I was so excited to try it.",

Yakitori and Robatayaki is the best and they have noodles too? Bonus!!!!\\n\\nEvery time i drove by the sign \\\"\"\"\"Yusho Japanese Grill & Noodle House\\\"\"\"\" I could just imagine myself eating tender cuts of charred chicken and steak off of skewers and then slurping up delicious noodles bathed in brothy goodness.  My mouth would water just at the thought of it.- I could not wait for this place to open its doors because it's such a perfect combo and there really is nobody on the strip doing this at a reasonable price.  \\n\\nBOOOM!....AWAKEN FROM THE DREAM.....\\n\\nAs i walked in i noticed was there was a lot of outdoor patio furniture clumsily arranged in front of the entrance...uh oh i felt a disturbance in the Japanese Feng Shui force. \\n\\nMaking my way into the restaurant i was greeted immediately by a very friendly staff  perhaps too friendly...........\\n\\nThe restaurant has a very simple atmosphere  not reminiscent of any kind street food dining i have ever encountered. It's more like this cafeteria i went to at Depauw University in Indiana that i was visiting back in 1998.   Dark wood colors and  a blend of white and yellow light that is confusing  mixed with bad fabrics and colors that don't match.  What ever happened to the good ol Japanese Feng Shui? I am not a feng Shui expert but if i was i would give it 1 Feng on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being a perfect Feng Shui.   There was definitely no Feng Shui Consultant involved in any part of the design of this place. \\n\\nThe articles have praised Yusho as a high end elevated take on Japanese street food. When i think of Japanese street food i think of carts lining the streets with smoke bellowing off grills as delicious cuts of meat on skewers are charring on the grill and ladles of noodles and steamy bowls of brothy goodness are being served in big bowls to a bustling crowd of hungry folk who only have a 15 minute lunch break.   \\n\\nOur order of elevated Japanese street food:\\n\\nChub sausage steamed bun -- No elevation here it was just terrible couldn't eat more than one bite.  Terrible blood sausage. Since when is Sweet and Gritty good?  I still get a little sick just thinking about it. \\n\\nDuck Leg w Steam Bun -- No elevation-- pretty standard on this if you want a little duck and some bread and you have $25 to spare this will do. If i was stuck on a deserted island with only a Yusho restaurant to survive i would probably just eat these. \\n\\nChicken Wings-- No elevation I like my wings with a little crispiness to them...there was no crispiness...  These were slimy and stuffed with a  filling that made it taste like a chicken meatball more than a wing.  No Yakitori or Robatayaki flavor goodness present. \\n\\nRamen Noodles-- Probably the worst non elevation--- Precariously balancing on the bowl was a  rectangular meat stick of what tasted like Panko crumb fried Bumble Bee Tuna. .... .......We were told it was pork.  Much better places for ramen in Vegas and at $22 for a small bowl this one made me really wish i could just beam myself out of there immediately.   Where's a federation starship when you need one?  \\n\\nThe hosts  server  busser provided excellent service.   Since this restaurant is part of the hotel we used our points for the meal and wanted to put a nice tip on a credit card because our waitress was the best ever and it's not her fault she has a terrible product to work with.  In comes a clueless aggressive girl manager who said they could not charge a tip on a credit card for the server and when i asked what they do when this happens she said that she encourages customers not to leave a tip. She reminded me of an angry badger. After a brief exchange of words where i educated her on the concept of protecting her staff.  She scampered away to try again and hallelujah she figured it out!  Obviously this is her first time as a restaurant manager. Sorry awesome staff your inexperienced angry badger manager is too lazy to help get you tips and is definitely the nail in the coffin for this place.  \\n\\nIf this food was not elevated  i think the tourists would like it and there would be a chance of success. Tourists won't like the food and when they have an issue the badger will crush them.   \\n\\nIt's just unbelievable that this  \\\"\"\"\"elevated\\\"\"\"\" street food is elevated by non other than Matthias Merges the executive chef from the infamous Charlie Trotters in Chicago- Arguably the greatest restaurant in modern Chicago History.  The only thing elevated about this place is the price. \\n\\nMathias  i think it would be wise to make it an authentic Japanese street food experience.  Change the menu and concept and fire the clueless manager! \\n\\nOverpriced  non elevated bad  food  dull atmosphere  with good staff except for the badger.  YU SHOuld say Sayonara to Yusho.\"",

We went earlier in the evening so it wasn't busy at all maybe three parties sitting in the restaurant.  Out of all the tables for a party of two she sits us closest to the smoky loud casino.  So I request to sit some where more on the inside  I didn't understand this concept for a nice strip restaurant.  \\nSo we ordered 2x fried chicken  Logan poser ramen  House made pickles  Japanese griddle cake  Grilled chicken wings.  I wasn't too impressed with any of them maybe the ramen then the grilled chicken wings.  I don't know what it was with our choices but everything seemed to have a strong sour after taste.  Like after drinking a shot of vinegar.  Even the ramen had something sour in it which kind of threw our flavor palette into thinking why does all of our food taste sour or have a sour ingredient in it.  The prices for the food was the normal strip price  but the amount and quality and quantity u want for the money u are paying for  eh  it's just not worth it for me.  Oh we tried the soft serve dessert and yep there was some kind of ingredient in there that they added as a sprinkle the made it sour too the soft serve was a expresso flavor  we didn't know what to make of it.  We see the concept and seems really interesting. The menu has interesting fusions and ingredients used.  But none of the flavors in our dishes was impactful or wow just so so and let's u leave the place thinking it wasn't worth it enough.   I may try another time but doesn't seem likely.",

We sat (on the sofa's to the right of the entrance doors where there's a small partition/wall that keeps anyone sitting there from seeing the band) for a good 35 minutes before anyone came over to ask for our drink orders. I actually got up to go to the bar a couple of times (not being able to get the bartenders attention) to order a drink and get a menu. There was a waitress who walked by our group of 6 many times to a table behind us to service them without ever looking our way. We finally were able to order drinks and it took another 30 minutes to get our drinks. Martinis=juice with a splash of liquor so I always stick to my regular tonic. Can't speak to the specialty martinis personally but my guest noted that they were just \\\"\"\"\"ok\\\"\"\"\". I ordered the chicken quesadillas and they were actaully pretty good for whay they were. Two of my guest ordered a bottle of wine to split. After the wine was poured it was placed on the table. Isn't a bottle of wine/champagne usually kept chilled in a bucket? No big deal  our waitress Nicole was knowledgable about the wines and cocktails on the menu and that was a good thing.

I don't write very many 1-star reviews unless my experience was truly horrible (see for yourself by checking out my stats).  \\n\\nMy 3 foodie friends and I came here around 6:30 and the place was almost empty.  Bad sign number 1.  \\n\\nOur waiter started apologizing for their poor paper menu and that it was because they were still testing out dishes...8 weeks after opening their doors.  I get that  I do.  But this wouldn't have been so essential to my dining experience if not for everything else you'll read here.  Bad sign number 2.\\n\\nOne of my girlfriends ordered the sweet potato fries right off the bat and another got their jalapeno poppers.  As soon as the fries were passed by my face to my friend  I immediately knew they were extremely bad.  They looked beyond done...almost burnt to a crisp.  I can't even believe they were served.  The chef or owner or even the waiter should have stopped them right at the kitchen door.  Sweet potato fries shouldn't be brown.  She did ask for them to be taken back  very politely actually.  Bad sign number 3.\\n\\nThe vibe of this place is pub-like or almost like a brewery.  Even the menu had a pub type of fare.  Yet  there was a Sriracha Lime Tilapia dish as well as some gourmet sounding bruschetta.  Hmph.  Interesting  weird really.  We ordered our food:  my sweet potato fry friend got her Beer Citrus shrimp  another got the bruschetta and an order of the mixed chips  while my jalapeno popper friend got fish 'n chips and I got their tilapia.  The first two dishes came out fairly quickly.  But my friend immediately said the citrus dip wasn't citrusy at all and my other friend made a face as she told us the bruschetta bread was downright gross.  It was not toasted and had a weird taste...doesn't sound like bruschetta to me.  Her mixed chips weren't mixed and were insanely greasy.  There was actually a pool of grease at the bottom of the basket/bowl.  Bad sign number 4  5  and 6.  \\n\\nMy other friend and I continued to wait for our dishes for 5 minutes  10 minutes  15 minutes.  Suddenly  I felt sick to my stomach (fairly certain it was from the one jalapeno popper) and I don't blame this on the restaurant at all.  TMI  but this is necessary information for bad sign number 100 below.  The waiter brought out a plate of fries and ketchup and told us he wanted us to munch on something while we waited.  He didn't exactly apologize for the wait or anything though.  None of us ate them because we were starting to get grossed out by the food at this point.\\n\\nOur food finally came out about 20 minutes later.  The cod were very small (for $12) and my tilapia didn't look appetizing at all (for $12 or $14).  Sort of a bad presentation.  But I didn't eat it because I didn't want to tempt fate with my stomach.  So  I asked our waiter if I could have a box...not telling him it was because of an upset stomach  he didn't need to know about that.  He never brought it out...bad sign...I lost count of bad signs by this time.  \\n\\nTen minutes later  a man silently walked up to our table and proceeded to stand above us and just stare.  My cod friend and I stopped our conversation after about a minute and looked up at him.  He didn't say anything  just stared. So  finally 1 of us inquired why he was there.  He awkwardly asked if we needed anything else in the most condescending and rude way.  I was uncomfortable and felt insanely unwelcome.  I told him I needed a box for my food.  I don't know if he assumed it's because I wasn't happy with my food or what  but he walked away rolling his eyes and scoffing.  Excuse me?!  What in the hell?!  I would have got up and walked out right then and there without paying if I had driven my own car.\\n\\nIt only got weirder from there.  I continued to watch the owner go to a couple other tables smiling and being somewhat friendly.  What did we exactly do to this guy to make him be so rude to us?  We weren't being rude at all.  But we do know he was aware there was some unhappiness happening at our table.  \\n\\nThroughout all of this  the waiter hardly ever came over and the manager/owner never really did come over to apologize for the poor service  mistakes made on the food  nothing!  \\n\\nI am a HUGE supporter of local restaurants and love them to death!  But with poor service like this and poor food  this place should NOT be in business.  I see a lot of reviewers love the beer selection and the owner seems to be very knowledgeable and friendly about those beers.  So  maybe he should open a microbrewery or something along those lines since the whole food part seems to make him unhappy and cranky.  You can't treat customers like this and expect us to return or spread a good word about you.  Customer service is number 1 and they have a TON to improve on.  I will NEVER return!",

I've been here multiple times and tried almost all the tacos so far  my favorites are the al pastor and the veggie. The al pastor is so flavorful with little chunks of pineapple on top... And you might think I'm crazy when I say the veggie taco is one of my favorites  most people like meat in their tacos  but this veggie taco is so tasty! Mashed potato in place of meat  mushrooms and what ever else veggies it has  perfect... It might just turn me vegetarian! Jk but it is very good. I'm not a beer fan at all  so I can't comment on the beers  but the cocktails I've had are the Dirty South Andy (kinda like a Moscow mule with little tweaks) and House Margarita (it has \\\"\"\"\"salt air\\\"\"\"\" instead of salted rim which is pretty unique and cool!). This place is pretty new still but I think once the word gets around it will be pretty popular!\"",

Unfortunately  although this place may be hidden  it is not a gem.\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to order and share a few items from the menu. We got the duck confit tacos  which were a daily special  deviled eggs  duck confit pizza and potato skins with croquettes.\\n\\nNone of the food we ordered was amazing but I did enjoy aspects of each dish. The duck in the pizza and tacos was really good  but the other items in each dish left a lot to be desired. The tacos needed a little more flavor. The tortillas were a little dry and the tomato and creme fraiche were bland. The pizza  which was more of a flatbread  was good but overly sweet. My dining companion came across lots of chiles on her slices but none of mine had any of that. The goat cheese added a nice savory flavor  but the fruit definitely overpowered this dish.  The deviled eggs were good  but very basic. I would recommend these at 50 cents each. The potato skins  which was basically half a potato cut into there measly slices served with three sad little cheese croquettes. These were the least appetizing of everything we ordered. Drippy and watery cheese inside a fried ball. I would not recommend this dish in the least. \\n\\nService was ok at first but once it was time to settle our bill  it took forever for someone to pay any attention to us at all. It was even more annoying given the fact that we were sitting at the bar. \\n\\nThe menu is ambitious  but lacks in execution. This would be a great bar to enjoy watching a game or fight  but I don't think I would have much reason to return.",

We're asians so rice is really important  lol.  15 minutes passed = no rice and no rolls.  I was starting to get irritated and I was hungry so we just ate again  without any of what was promised.\\n\\nWhat you'll notice about the servers:\\n1) They hover by the kitchen... trying to avoid or delay the bad news they have to deliver\\n\\n2) They'll ask how you're doing but very few genuinely care\\n\\n3) They'll say they'll check on it and will only remember to tell you their findings WHEN you call them over again.  Aren't you supposed to return from your mission?  Lol.\\n\\nThe rolls finally came - only three by the way for two people (which was supposed to make up for the uncooked rice we both bit into??  And have been missing since??). This was on the house so that was generous *sarcasm*.  Rice was 1.99 each and we ordered two.  That's $4.  Rolls are $1.75 for three.  Whatever.  They were just like the kind you buy at the store  except warmed up.  I don't know why it took that long.\\n\\nBy the time we were told the rice was on its way  we already finished the shrimp.  So the rice would have been useless.\\n\\nIMO:  Food is good.  Customer service sucks.",

One thing I've concluded about Thai in Vegas is that  while still probably the best collection in the states  they are inconsistent.  I've had great meals at Krung Thai  and then came back for a decidedly mediocre meal the next.  Same experiences at Archi's  Kung Fu  and handful of others.  Lotus of Siam is consistently good  but consistently salty.\\n\\nSo my experiment continues  as I search for that go-to place.  Thai Style Noodle House was an utter failure  and Pam Real Thai was very mediocre.  I saw Arisra on Yelp with only a handful of reviews  but for the most part good.  It appears the resto really took the time to post a lot of pictures also (I suspect it was the restaurant  not the reviewers)  both of which didn't give me a ton of comfort.  But what the heck  I was really in the mood for some crispy Thai fish which I hadn't had in forever  and this was a Thai seafood restaurant  so I took the chance.\\n\\nWe walked in at 4:30pm so as we expected it was empty.  The sign actually said they open at 5pm  but they were happy to have us in.  Very pleasant greetings  which continued throughout the meal.  The interior is not-quite modern and not-quite traditional  but not awkward either.  It felt cozy with modern-ish furniture mixed in with some typical Thai decor.  A stage sat at the corner  which I imagine is for a performer or karaoke typical to many Thai restaurants.  I should go there during night time sometime...\\n\\nI ordered a beer (Chang  no Singha) even though the Thai Mai Tai sounded good.  I'm thinking if the level 8 spicy we ordered on the spicy fried rice was burning hot  I can chug the beer.  Not so much the Mai Tai.  We also order the crispy fish of the day (Sea Bass  I think) and BBQ Squid.  Order takes some time - they are not fast - but what we receive looks very good with good presentation.  The squid is typical grilled squid  but comes with a sweet chili sauce on top and what looked and tasted like Thai chili salsa-like thing on the side.  Both sauce were great  although the salsa-thing was salty.  The fried rice was good and the fish was great.  Definitely satisfied the craving  and just what I was hoping for with super crispy skin and sweet chili sauce.  Neither were very salty as well.  3.5 stars for the squid and rice  4.5 for the fish so it's a qualified 4-stars on food.\\n\\nCombine that with a cozy atmosphere  some live music (not while we were there)  and pleasant service and we have a solid 4 stars.  I will definitely be coming here again because they have the most extensive seafood dishes I've seen at a Thai restaurant including about half-dozen fish dishes  and I want to try more of them.  It will also give me a chance to see if they meet my consistency test.\\n\\nTable-for-1 Factor:  It was perfectly fine while I was there  but I wonder if it will be different during busy time?  As it was  there should be no awkwardness eating alone.",

Meaning  that the servers need to pace the kitchen  watch the tables  get more drinks to the guests  up that ticket avg. That timing is great for time-pressed lunch crowds. \\n\\nIt should become a NoSco hotspot with a long lifespan. It's immediate competitors are: FourPeaks and TwinPeaks. (actually delete TwinPeaks  it's just terrible in so many ways). FourPeaks has the beer  the size  the longevity. But I think the two can co-exist happily and thrive. \\n\\nWe will be back...\"",

The polite hostesses told us to come back in about a half an hour  which was no problem - I assumed the restaurant would be crowded and busy  as it just opened.  When we returned  we waited a little longer  then were seated near the bar.  The restaurant has an amazing view of the strip  but we couldn't see anything from our table.  The restaurant was about half empty  leading me to believe this was more of a soft open - I know they haven't been open for lunch long.\\n\\nService was very friendly.  I had the Prosecco sangria  which was delicious  and we had some fantastic chicken meatballs.  The bread they brought out at the beginning of the meal was absolutely wonderful  though a bit greasy. I was very disappointed to see that there was only one pasta dish on the menu for lunch - I thought for sure Giada was famous for her delicious pasta dishes!  I couldn't order the baked pasta  as it contains pork  so I went for the lemon pesto grilled cheese  served with spiralized zucchini and potatoes.  It was quite good  but it took a really  really long time to come out.  Like  probably 40 minutes.  It's a grilled cheese!  We were getting pretty antsy - not to mention hungry - and we prefer spending our time wandering around Vegas  not sitting in a booth.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the muffeletta sandwich  a wedge of bread with various cured meats.  We later realized this sandwich is premade and is sitting with the antipasto items in the front deli case area.  Why did it take 40 minutes to put a premade sandwich on a plate with salad?  He found the bread somewhat soggy  likely because it's premade.  It didn't take long after we left the restaurant for my husband to start to feel ill and nauseous; he ended up out of commission the rest of the day.  I'm not sure how long the sandwiches were sitting in the case  but it might have been just a touch too long.  He had not eaten anything else that day save a banana  and he hadn't had anything to drink but water.\\n\\nThe wait staff was very kind and attentive every step of the way.  However  it appears that they just haven't worked out lunch yet.  I would not return.",

        "text": "\"After reading the glowing reviews on Facebook  I decided to make the short drive to DeForest and check out BB Jacks.  After suffering through some service issues and some lackluster food  I learned two things:\\n1. Never trust Facebook for restaurant reviews (Didn't mean to cheat on you Yelp  it's just you were slow on the draw on getting this new restaurant listed.)\\n2. I will not be returning to BB Jack's anytime soon.\\n\\nMy daughter had a late soccer game in Waunakee  so I decided to call in a carryout order for a pizza and a Reuben sandwich.  I was told that my order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes  just the amount of time I needed to drive from Waunakee to DeForest.  Things were looking good...\\n\\nI arrive 15 minutes after I called  checked in at the bar and lo and behold  my pizza was ready to go.  I paid for my order; the bartender brought my pizza to the bar and thanked me for my order.  One small problem  no Reuben sandwich.  When I asked the bartender about its status  I got a confused look and he scampered into the kitchen.  He came out  told me it was not ready yet  and then tended to the other customers at the bar  which was packed on a Thursday evening.\\n\\nSo I waited...and waited...and waited.  \\n\\nAnd I watched my pizza get colder...and colder...and colder.\\n\\nOne of the servers sitting at the bar told me the kitchen prepared the pizzas in a separate area from the rest of the food.  Uh  OK  a useful fact if I ever get a question about BB Jack's kitchen operations during trivia night  but what I really want to know if when my sandwich will be ready.\\n\\nAfter ten minutes  another server saw me impatiently waiting by the bar and asked if I have been helped.  I explained my situation and he checked with the kitchen to check on the status of the sandwich.  He indicated it will be a couple of minutes and offers me a drink while I wait.\\n\\nThe sandwich shows us thirteen minutes after my pizza and I hit the road.\\n\\nThe good news first: the tater tots that accompanied my sandwich were well prepared - hot  crispy on the outside and not too greasy.  The folks at BB Jacks have mad deep frying skills.  I could have done without the powdered parmesan cheese sprinkled on top  but if that's their signature touch  so be it. \\n\\nTo say my Reuben sandwich was dismal would be an understatement.  The main ingredient of the BB Jacks Reuben is a thick layer of bland sauerkraut  which turned my sandwich into a soggy mess by the time I got it home.  The bread was supermarket quality marble rye and needed to be cut thicker to hold up to the all the wet kraut.  The sad layer of corned beef was excessively salty.  The 1000 island dressing had the consistency of warm jello.  It was a paint-by-the-numbers sandwich using institutional grade ingredients.  \\n\\nThe half pepperoni / half cheese pizza also was a bust.  The crust was on the thin side and had no chew and little flavor.  The sauce was applied unevenly  with some spots swimming in sauce and other with just a trace.  The cheese had a strange filmy quality.  I had a couple of pieces and it was so bad that it had me questioning my belief that there is no such thing as a bad slice of pizza.  The capper was that my daughter found a hair on one of her slices.  It was so bad that we didn't even keep the leftovers; the uneaten slices were dumped in the garbage with nary a complaint from my family.\\n\\nAfter my dismal experience  I wrote messaged the owner of the restaurant to express my disappointment with the quality of my experience.  To their credit  I received a prompt response from the restaurant manager apologizing for the mix-up on my carryout order.\\n\\nI really hate to dole out one star ratings  but given the problems with my carryout order and the weak-ass food  the dreaded \\\"\"\"\"Eek! Methinks not\\\"\"\"\" description is apropos given my lackluster experience.\"",

But this place. It was dead and slow so you would think they would want all the people they could get. Even from the strip you couldn't hear the music. Pretty weak. \\n\\nAdvice: if you're thinking of going here...DONT. Go else where for cheaper and have way more fun and not feel like your at your parents house with all the rules.",

My barber's name was Marcos. I came in with a full head of hair and told Marcos I want a trim on top with a number two blade on the sides and told him to taper it. Marcos leaves less than 1 inch of hair on top and gives me a high and tight military style haircut.

Marcos couldn't even blend it correctly. I look like a pineapple  hair on top and buzzed on the sides.

That sounds like good news to me and good is what I was expecting. Unfortunately  my hopes were shot down soon after watching my friend order food. \\n\\nThey have a boba place inside as well as a place where you can order dishes like a restaurant and a place where you can order food down a line like Panda Express. Looking at the prices that they had at the boba place  it was a little pricy and I can't expect it to have that much better quality than somewhere off the strip  and so I deem the price a little higher than normal. I understand rent must be expensive  but they won't be making money with higher prices. \\n\\nThe area where you can order food had a variety of dishes from different Asian cuisines  but this again was a little expensive. I can't imagine it tasting any better than somewhere off the strip at a specific ethnic restaurant  and especially for the price they were charging  $11 for fried rice is a little much. They also have dim sum & dumplings and they list it out what kind they have on the window. The prices are a little expensive for how much they give you  which is the usual 4 at traditional dim sum places. $4.99+ for an order is not worth getting while you are there  you might as well go out somewhere else off the strip for dim sum. \\n\\nThe area where you can pick out food like at Panda Express was also pricy and it didn't look very good  it seemed as though it was sitting out there for a while. When my friend ordered food from there  she got the duck and they microwaved it... You know  when you're at home at they're leftovers  it's ok to microwave food  but when you order food from outside of your own home  that ain't cool bro. That right there was just shocking for me that a place would even do that. So I don't think the food will look too appetizing unless it came fresh out of the kitchen  just make sure they don't microwave the food before they give it to you.\\n\\nLast but not least  when my friend's food was finished  they brought the food out to where we were sitting. When the waitress (or whatever category you want to put them in) brought out her food  the tray didn't have utensils and the waitress said she forgot and asked her to get it herself. Umm... I think that's a little bit rude to say  and you have a job where you mostly stand right next to the front anyways  so I don't understand why she couldn't have just gotten them right after. \\n\\nI don't mind the higher prices of the places inside the Linq  I can at least understand that much  but when you have unappealing food  microwave food  and have bad service  that's a big nono there.

Since I like Yogurtland  I was excited when this location opened up in Henderson. \\n\\nJust like the Town Square location  by biggest gripe with this Yogurtland is that they do not cut their fruit toppings smaller. And that is admittedly a very minor gripe. \\nThis location also gets rather busy in the evenings...  Currently on Monday evenings  buy-1-get-1-free promotion that runs from 4-7 pm  you can pretty much count on a long line on Mondays. \\n\\nThe good far outweighs the bad at Yogurtland in my opinion. There is always a large selection of flavors  including sugar free options. The yogurt and toppings have nutritional info like the calories count per ounce  helpful for us ladies watching our waistlines. The staff is usually quite friendly and helpful. The toppings are fresh  there is a good variety of fruit toppings as well candy  and my personal favorite popping boba! \\n\\nBe sure to download the Yogurtland app  not only do you not have to dig through your wallet for a rewards card  but you also get 3 free ounces if you do!",

Otherwise  there's a lot of classics to choose from as well  like the Pad Thai  and the selection of curries.

A lot of food for $7  easy to share with at least 3 people.\\n\\nRed curry: spicy (be warned if you can't take the heat) without losing the inherent flavor of the dish. Very brothy  which I personally prefer. I got the tofu because of a yelper who said they don't typically love tofu but this tofu is an exception.

Shared a brisket and a turkey sandwich along with sides of coleslaw  potato salad and a cobbler with my mom. \\nThere was a really bad propane taste to the turkey.  The brisket was ok. Not anything to rave about. The BBQ sauce you add yourself at the table  which the spouts were clogged.  \\nNow I really thought that they would have some good potato salad and coleslaw being a BBQ place. I was very wrong.  Not homemade.  Tasted like any store bought deli products.  Ewe. \\nI guess that I had high hopes for the cobbler. Was kinda scared to try it after the salads. Yep disappointed.  I have actually had better frozen store bought. \\nI hate to do a bad review but really if the food was better I'd totally give it a great review.  I think the whole concept they have is cool and the decorations are totally western BBQ cool. Even the patio for when it cools down would be great.  But you don't go there for the decorations.",

My hubby and two friends and I grabbed one of the metal buckets and filled it with yeasty beverages while we waited.  \\n\\nLet me just preface this entire review now (as if the first sentence didn't already cover it)...I have two simple words to describe it.  Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland.  Does that about cover it?\\n\\nWe decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs  fatty brisket  and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw  beans  and chocolate pudding.  The coleslaw was insanely bland.  What am I talking about?!  The entire tray of meat was everything but flavorful.  \\n\\nAs soon as they put the ribs on our tray  I turned to my husband and asked him  \\\"\"\"\"What the heck is that?\\\"\"\"\"  It was gray and looked like cardboard.  The fatty brisket they laid down was a lousy excuse for fatty brisket.  As a brisket expert  my husband realized their \\\"\"\"\"fatty brisket\\\"\"\"\" is actually the lower part of the point  which is dry and normally chopped and served on sandwiches because it isn't pretty and it certainly isn't fatty.  The link looked hopeful though.  I totally dug the hot carrots!!!  \\n\\nSo  Texas BBQ is supposed to not require any sauce at all.  But this stuff had to be doused in it!  I had to bathe my meat in it for goodness sakes.  There was absolutely no flavor to any of the meat and no seasoning (and by that I mean salt and pepper) in sight.  \\n\\nNever will I ever go back to Rudy's.  And I am NOT just writing this subpar review because of LMB...I honestly and truthfully was grossed out and extremely let down by the appearance  taste  and lackluster flair of their food. Sure Little Miss BBQ is a bit more of a drive  but their meat is juicy  flavorful  and doesn't require any sauce whatsoever.  Their sides are tasty too.\"",

I'm definitely on the indecisive side when it comes to ordering anything  but they have so many different categories of \\\"\"\"\"teas\\\"\"\"\" such as Flirteas (fruity flavors)  Naughteas (creamy flavors)  etc. It's a fun concept for each drink to have a cool name  but it took me a while to decipher that menu.  I do like how they have three options for sizes of drinks.\\n\\nCLUELESS: This Flirtea drink was made with guava  watermelon  lemon  strawberry  and green.  It normally comes with lychee jelly (or \\\"\"\"\"gobi\\\"\"\"\" as they called it here)  but I switched it out for boba without any charge.  Flavor and their quality of boba was surprisingly pretty good!!\\n\\nGOLDEN TEA BOBA: I think this was a make your own kind of tea option. Could not find it on their menu lol  shows how complicated it is.  Was recommended this and it totally reminds me of Lollicup's milk tea haha. \\n\\nPlenty of options and they can also adjust the amount sweetness per request.  What's unique here that I don't see often is that they have options for sweeteners in your drinks (i.e.: agave  honey  etc.) A little on the pricey side because it's in a nice mall  but that's expected.\"",

My girlfriend and I were seated immediately with the restaurant fairly busy. We were both surprised at how nice the interior was; dimly lit with old photos of the owners in their 1950s prime. It was very nice and felt welcoming.\\n\\nThen the problems started. It took at least 12-15 minutes for our waiter to come by (granted  someone came by to say he'd be by \\\"\"\"\"soon\\\"\"\"\" and that they were very busy)  but when he did  he walked up  said hello and introduced himself  then he went to go check to see if we were his table  then came back and said he'd be back in a minute and went five feet away to a table that had been seated after us and took their drink orders. It was absolutely ridiculous. Almost laughable. We didn't order drinks solely for that reason.\\n\\nWhen he finally did come by  we just wanted to order and eat since we were starving. Following that  it was another 15 minutes of waiting before we got bread (we had to ask). I ordered the chicken parmigiano and my girlfriend ordered the potato gnocci. The gnocci was great and being as famished as I was  I was so excited to eat my meal  only to be completely let down. The first bite of the chicken I spit out. I don't do that  but I had to. It was this chewy  rubbery texture that I thought was fat. It turned out the entire chicken was pretty much the same consistency. We deduced that it was a really cheap cut of chicken. At least it wasn't under cooked (which I thought it was at first). Regardless  it was almost inedible. Oh and $7 to split the check? Not that we needed to  but good god that's ridiculous. \\n\\nI just moved to town and I really wanted to like Annie's  but I saw little charm or reason to ever visit again despite the decor  which  unfortunately  you cannot eat.\\n\\nOne star is harsh  but I think in our case  it is completely warranted.

That's all they did.\\n\\nThis entire process has been ridiculously difficult and we are incredibly unhappy so we won't be using their services in the future. The Amazon deal was to pay $50 for a $298 service.\\n\\nFirst of all I was able to make the appointment with someone (that said eco air?)  but someone else called me multiple times only once leaving me a message - in that message stating I could not have the appointment (5 days before my appointment that I made 3 weeks prior). I confirmed with the guy from the email that my appointment with still on yet I received multiple phone calls after that. I finally called back not knowing who us air was and they told me that the technician could not come out between the scheduled time and did not have any other options really for me that were convenient. I also did not appreciate the way I was asked why someone wouldn't be around at 3 p.m. In the afternoon to which I replied that most people are working during that time.\\n\\nI told the girl that I would call her back and asked my fiance to call because I needed to get back to work.

Today we received  a phone call from the technician stating that he could be on his way in 20 minutes and it was 230 in the afternoon. \\nAfter they arrived they asked about the voucher and stated that it was only a $50 voucher and therefore there were certain services they would not do. I told my fiance that the voucher was $50 yes but the value was 298 dollars.\\n\\nSo after the ridiculous scheduling debacle I guess I shouldn't be surprised they didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing when they came to my house. They also for some reason plugged into an extension cord I had and almost immediately blew the circuit.\\n\\nThey ONLY vacuumed and brushes the vents - a $50 service according to the tech. He kept saying we only paid $50 so that was all we were getting. Which is funny  because it was worth $298. REALLY? So - I guess we got what we paid for. A few days later the company US AIR called to ask if the tech had come to visit. Why does no one know what each other is doing?\\n\\nStay away!",

The restaurant only had two people assigned our area (we had at least 100 people and over 15 tables). We personally waited 15 minutes just to get our drink order then we placed our food order and waited well over an hour for our food. By the time we received our food several of the tables in our group decided to leave and go to the Cook Out to get better service and actually have their dinner after finding out that the order they had placed over an hour earlier hadn't even been started yet in the kitchen!!! The management knew we were coming well in advance yet chose to schedule a light staff in the dining room and in the kitchen. The food was mediocre at best and I only gave it one star because zero stars was not an option.",

I had a driver once who had baked cookies and they were fresh and delish. I had another driver with a free wifi hotspot in his car. They are usually available around the clock and I usually don't have to wait more than 10 minutes for them to arrive. It's a pleasure to ride in a Lyft.

I've also been here for my post-workout birthday lunch and a few other times...all because of a bowl of vegetables!\\n\\nChicken:\\nChicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5\\n\\nRainbow Cauliflower:\\nThis is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact  I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky  a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5\\n\\nCocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak:\\nTender slices of beef with pink on the middle.

The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5\\n\\nGyro Tacos:\\nGreek tacos with tender meat  feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5\\n\\nChicken Skin:\\nComes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5\\n\\nTomato Stack:\\nCaprese salad  basically. 4/5\\n\\nMac n Cheese:\\nI don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top  the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5\\n\\nDevil's Eggs:\\nDeviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious.

Another yelper commented on how the restaurant and ambiance reminded them of being in San Francisco and I agree. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Vegas anymore. I loved the restaurant's quaint and modern design but I especially enjoyed the charming ambiance on their roof top dining area  the booths were very comfortable and there was just the right amount of lighting too. \\n \\nNow  let's get to the good stuff: the food! \\n \\nThe crispy chicken skins arrived with a side of smoked honey for dipping = insane! Honey Boo Boo  this thing is real good! The skins were seasoned expertly and fried to crazy  crispy perfection; I couldn't get enough of that airy  crunchy skin - it wasn't even oily. Don't even get me started on the smoked honey -delectable- you can bet your sweet life they were meant to be eaten together. It's a must-order and for $6  the portion was perfect for two.\\n \\nWe also went all in on the bacon jam with baked brie and grilled baguette at $12  It's the most popular item on the menu and now I know why. It came out bubbling hot and was incredibly bacon-y  jam-y  brie-y  salty  sweet and  yes  it was pretty darn magical.\\n \\nTo offset the naughtiness that is crispy chicken skins and bacon jam  we also ordered roasted young beets with pistachio  mandarin orange slices and goat cheese at $8. The beets were roasted till perfect tenderness  naturally sweet  and the dish was simple but very tasty. It was the perfect option to complement the richness of the bacon jam.\\n \\nWe also grabbed an order of the black rice and oxtail risotto with Parmesan cream for $14  though  we thought it was way too cheesy (if that's even a problem?) Based on the menu description  we were expecting more of a smoother Parmesan cream-like consistency  but we ended up with more of a dense  stringy texture. Our waitress was wonderful and could tell that we weren't too thrilled with the consistency when she checked on us  so she generously offered to replace the dish with something else that we would be able to enjoy. We decided on the rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash and Parmesan at $12 - everything on this dish was seasoned very well; I also really enjoyed the light tomato cream sauce and the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. Surprisingly  the overall dish wasn't too heavy. I personally wouldn't order it again  (rabbit is just not my thing) but my boyfriend went to town on it and really enjoyed it. \\n \\nI'm completely satisfied with the level of service and care that we were offered here. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered  plus the simply tasty food is well worth a quick return! I can't wait to come back and order some more of those chicken skins all to myself!",

        "text": "\"THE INTRO:\\n--Despite my low two-star rating attributed to this restaurant  I would point out that it is a brand-new restaurant and they may be still working out some of the kinks.  I would consider this as you read my review.  We were at the restaurant for 2.5 hours.  My goal when deciding on a restaurant this evening was to dine with a couple (2) of friends that just wanted to have a nice sit-down meal to celebrate someone's birthday.  We ultimately chose this restaurant because it was new  had done some great marketing  and there was a lot of hype about the quality of the food  the d\\u00e9cor and the location.\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n--the d\\u00e9cor is great - walls made out of solid concrete with a cool fireplace (it's not real fire  but very cool nonetheless)  comfortable seats  a couple of wine cellars  soft lighting but still strong enough to see everything nicely  and a winding staircase going up to the second floor; and\\n--the quality of the steak - it was cooked just the way I ordered (rare) and had a wonderful charcoal-tasting sear on the outside.  Contrary to another poster  the steak was not drenched in salt.\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\n--speed of kitchen service - anything that we ordered from the kitchen (whether that was a snack  appetizer  main dish  or dessert) took a long time to arrive.  Excessively long.  We ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our main meal (we had had martinis with the snacks  etc.  before the main meal).  The waitress brought over the bottle (Penfolds Bin 9) immediately after the main meal was ordered and  amazingly  we managed to finish off the bottle of wine before the steak arrived!  We didn't \\\"\"\"\"chug\\\"\"\"\" back the wine  either: we took our time.  Service was equally slow for the starters\\n--I feel bad saying this  but our waitress just didn't seem to fit in this calibre of restaurant--there was just something about her service that was a little \\\"\"\"\"off\\\"\"\"\" by the comments that she made to us during the meal and her general demeanor came off as a bit \\\"\"\"\"brusque\\\"\"\"\";\\n--the quality of the starters - we ordered smoked cheese fritters and Japanese dumplings.  The dumplings were warm  not hot.  The quality was only okay.  Unfortunately  in a place like this  \\\"\"\"\"okay\\\"\"\"\" doesn't cut it.  You'll see why in the next line; and\\n--the quality / quantity / price ratios (le rapport qualit\\u00e9-prix) - the bill came out to $100 / person but the size of the dishes (quantity) and the taste of the food (quality - except for the steak which was great) just didn't justify the price  and that's taking into consideration the nice d\\u00e9cor.\"",

I ordered the taro slush sensation  and a friend of mine got the thai tea  green tea float  and mango slush sensation. The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me  first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam  but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float  he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good  like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it  like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland  the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down  and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture  not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized  that was the only redeeming order of that day. The workers were pretty nice but not very helpful or knowledgeable at all on their products  it was more like ordering from a vending machine with no personality or presence unfortunately.

The atmosphere was what you'd expect when going to a nice dinner out. However  I am not sure what has happened in the last few months. Apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the better options  including the macaroni and cheese and salmon BLT. Big mistake. We ordered the 2 for $20  which is a little misleading on menu. You're thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza  which in some cases is not even getting as better dealthan just ordering individually. Definitely not worth the money. We spent $29 with tip for a tiny pizza   two very small salads  and my husband's iced tea. I wouldn't have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good  but it was not. It was just average. We were left unsatisfied and very disappointed. Also  we went on a Wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet place to eat. Instead  they had half of the restaurant closed off with a DJ playing loud music for what I'm assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually. However  there were only the DJ and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner. Seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early  playing music so loud that we couldn't even hear each other speak. This place had more of a sports bar feel with Italian food. If you're drinking then you'll probably be ok with the mediocre food. However  if you want a nice dinner  we suggest you go somewhere else. We had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse. The food is not as good  the options are few  and the atmosphere has gone downhill. We definitely won't be going back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well.",

Better late than never right?\\n\\nSo  I've been a diehard Germany soccer fan for a few years now. I was really excited this World Cup and had already watched 2 games at the Hofbrauhaus which cost me more than I'd like to talk about. Let's just say I have no qualms with drinking at 8am. SO on a whim I decided to check out if there were any other German joints that were: 1. Closer to me and 2. More affordable. Lo and behold this place popped up on my search a WEEK after they opened! Talk about fate!\\n\\nI call them asking if they'll be showing the game that morning  to which I was told  \\\"\"\"\"If you're here for the game  our door will be open!\\\"\"\"\" So next morning I show up  decked out in my jersey and facepaint  and they let me in before operating hours to watch the game (Germany vs. France  we won of course) and serve me and my boyfriend beer. Talk about service! And getting to smell all the wonderful smells from the kitchen as they were preparing for the day made the day even better!\\n\\nNot to mention the food is SO GOOD. German cuisine  in my opinion at least  is the ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD. The potato salad (Kartoffelsalat) is a different variation of what I'm used to making or getting  but YUM! I wanted spaetzle  but the machine was broken that day  thankfully I was not disappointed with the salad at all. Topping off the whole experience is the expertly made from scratch Apfelstrudel. DO NOT HESITATE TO ORDER THIS! It is just like my Tante used to make  SEHR LECKER!\\n\\nI'll definitely be back here not only to enjoy the wonderfully authentic food  but to support the lovely people who accommodated a wild soccer fan on the day of the World Cup Quarterfinals.

It's definitely worth checking out the cocktail menu\\n- Staff is friendly but not exceptional yet\\n\\nThe not so good; I've tried a few things off the menu over 3 visits (Bacon dates  gnocchi  beef tartare  burrata  beets  porchetta pizza  bucatini carbonara  pork chop  cauliflower) so I think the following thoughts are pretty accurate. In general  the food doesn't measure up to the ambiance or price.\\n\\n- Gnocchi was overworked/gummy. They were described as \\\"\"\"\"pillows\\\"\"\"\" and they definitely didn't come out that way. I mentioned this in passing to our waitress when she asked how everything was and I got the impression that she didn't really put much credence in my feedback.  \\n- Food was underseasoned across the board. Pizza crust had very little flavor and the bucatini carbonara lacked salt - not sure how that's even possible given the fact that the ingredients include parmigiano and pork cheek (guanciale).\\n- Pork chop was overcooked (we wanted to try the beef or lamb but both were sold out when we went )\\n\\nI really hope the food continues to improve and I'm not ready to give up on Cento yet.

This company really strives to make sure that their customer satisfaction is truly guaranteed. The owner  Brooke  is super nice and addressed my concerns in such a kind manner. I happened to have time to stop by today for some pineapple whip and she wasn't there but I thought I would give it a try anyway. The guy ended up being another owner  her husband  and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review  but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now  he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again  texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area  you gotta try it.",

After all  if you don't have a good base  none of your donuts will be good. So  I got a plain raised and some sort of turtle cheesecake donut. \\n\\nI took the plain one out  turned it over and took a sniff. No  I don't have a donut fetish. What I want to smell is that nice  yeasty fresh donut smell. Nope. All I smelled was sugar.  Let me backup to say that when I walked into the shop  I was surprised that it didn't have that \\\"\"\"\"OMG fresh baked donut\\\"\"\"\" smell. Now I know why. \\n\\nSo  tasting the plain donut was an adventure only my dentist would love. It tasted like nothing but sugar. The glaze had to be the sweetest I've ever tasted. Usually glaze is powdered sugar and some sort of liquid - milk  melted butter  lemon juice  whatever. What did they do  mix their sugar with corn syrup?  So  giving up on the plain after a couple bites  I went to the turtle cheesecake one. I will say the cheesecake filling was nice  but again the donut itself had no flavor. The topping was pretty good but again very sweet. \\n\\nI'm disappointed and expected more after everything I've seen and read.

        "text": "I don't know if we went on an off night (I have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well).  But  to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in  I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this  it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs  but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table  how about dropping a hundred at roulette?  \\n\\nThe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far  so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling  the music is loud  there are alligator heads on the wall  and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy  and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly  and stayed friendly  but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on  he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also  a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded  it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip  but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling  two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed  empty  for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix  yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know  they still are.\\n\\nAs other yelpers note  the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree  this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham  the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture)  but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff  and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them  sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic  highly recommended  but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12  and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of b\\u00e9chamel flavor.  Loved these things  I could have easily eaten another order.  \\n\\nA couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it  they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one  but we had other things on our mind....\\n\\nLike the steaks.  Unfortunately  they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye  which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result  we went with the Mishiwa Reserve  which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly  our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now  I don't carry a scale with me to dinner  but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But  we were hungry  and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server  but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right  but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know  maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also  this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally  it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it)  but we weren't happy.\\n\\nWe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy  flavorful  with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could  but all of us could have used more.  \\n\\nFor sides  we went with the Delmonico potatoes  asparagus  and carrots.  All were good  the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small  but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.\\n\\nWe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They  like the rest of the meal  were hit and miss.\\n\\nOverall  I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above  I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did  November 15  2014  that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But  for what we paid  a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return  but not for a long time  and I will definitely bring a scale....",

I stopped in and ordered a \\\"\"\"\"Monday's Special\\\"\"\"\" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza  I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza  but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should  but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open  so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes  but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent  I can see coming back.\\n\\nMost pizza joints have a \\\"\"\"\"slice special\\\"\"\"\" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well  here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special.

That's ok--they'd been open for a week. The food was pretty good  but I wasn't blown away. I liked the choice of sparkling or still water. The menu was a mess  though; basically just a list of ingredients for each item  leaving the presentation a mystery. The service was very good  though  especially for it being such a new place.\\n\\n2nd visit  a week or two later: out of half the menu again. Nothing that was left sounded that good. Waitress was snotty. We left and went to Fenwick's instead.\\n\\n3rd visit  this past weekend: we arrived at 11:20am. For the THIRD time in a row  they were out of the burger. (Already?!) We had the boule breakfast sandwich and the bison chorizo grits. The boule was good  but kind of bland. The grits were flavorless and hardly had any chorizo. The drip coffee was excellent  though  and the server (I think her name was Shannon) was wonderful. But  overall  it was yet another underwhelming experience. I don't think I'll give it a 4th try unless I hear they've stepped up their game. It's such a shame that such a beautiful restaurant with such a great concept manages to fall so flat.",

If you're looking for craft cocktails or even a beer  a great environment  and wonderful company  this is the place! You're welcome to read my (long) review below if you want to know more. \\n\\nThe Location: Located at the Container Park  which is only a block from Fremont  Oak & Ivy is close for tourists  but far enough away from the Vegas hustle and bustle for locals. During the day  all hard alcohol must stay on the premises  but you're able to walk around  shop  and eat if you're only having beer. Whether you want to explore the park  or hang out inside with other patrons and the bartenders  you'll have a good time!\\n\\nThe Staff: Every single bartender at Oak & Ivy is wonderful! They are all knowledgable and able to make whatever you throw at them. They are even willing and able to recommend cocktails you've never experienced based on your preferences. However  Pinto is my fav. He has proven that I can love gin and Bloody Mary's along with given me recommendations on how to \\\"\"\"\"wow\\\"\"\"\" others when I make cocktails! Never had a bad convo or cocktail when I've stopped in!\\n\\nThe Drinks: Although they specialize in craft cocktails and whiskey  there is something for everyone here. Multiple beers are on tap and in bottles. They mix up they're menu with signature cocktails (like a pumpkin inspired Sleepy Hollow) and have they're most popular drinks like the coveted Moscow Mule with house made ginger beer. If you're feeling more inspired/adventurous  challenge them to make you something wild or let them decide on a drink for you! You simply can't go wrong.\"",

        "text": "\"In their defense  I will open this review by saying they have only been in this location for a week. HOWEVER  they ran a business at another location so that \\\"\"\"\"learning curve\\\"\"\"\" thing should not apply.  The atmosphere is not there yet and that is okay - they gotta get the furniture and decor going but first things first - food and drink and servers.\\n\\nWe came after reading so many good reviews of their Phoenix location - and with LivingSocial in hand.\\n\\nIt is apparent that they still need to figure out how to run the front side of their business - there were 6 tables occupied with 3 servers  a bartender  two management types - and i think it was the owner that came out of the kitchen and took our beverage order.  Really? And those servers were running like chickens without heads.\\n\\nWe tried to figure out what the coupon covered but couldn't get a straight answer so we just ordered 2-meat combos with one side each.  The brisket was a $2 upcharge so we ordered pulled pork and brisket  one with slaw  the other mac and cheese.\\n\\nUnfortunately  I think they had to go chase that damn pig down (not the cow  for heavens' sake - those animals are slow and there is no chasing involved) because it took 50 minutes to get our dinner. 50 minutes. almost an hour. now  let's think about this.  that meat was already smoked. the mac should have already been made. and the same with the slaw. what would take 50 minutes? i have no flipping idea. \\n\\nWhen the meals came  they both had mac and slaw. I said something to the server who said well that's how they come. Sigh. If we had known they were coming with two sides  I would not have gotten slaw with my mac and my hubs would not have gotten mac with his slaw.  This is like the story of the Reese's peanut butter cup with not such a sweet ending LOL  And....no bbq sauce.  Hmmm. Let me see.  BBQ restaurant. Ordered BBQ.  Maybe you want to put some on the plate?\\nIn their defense  they brought it upon request.....in a teenie tiny little salad dressing cup...... bwahahahaha..... \\n\\nPulled pork was nicely seasoned. Tasted like a shoulder to me.  Good and smoky. Moist. Little bit of charing on the outside.  That cow  however  did not fare nearly as well. If the poor fellow would have known that is how he would have ended up  he would have fought harder at that slaughterhouse - or at least tried to run a little faster. That brisket was well on the way to jerky-dom when we got it. And - it was tasteless. Seriously. No smoke. No rub. No moist. Just dry meat. So pork yes  beef no.\\n\\n Slaw? Meh. Very mayo-ish with not much else. I am a creamy slaw girl myself and still make it the way mom did at the restaurant.  I figured it for a southern slaw place but they apparently ran out of celery seed that day as there were maybe 3 seeds in a serving so it was a rather lackluster slaw. \\n\\nMac was.......odd.  It was cheesy  No egg. Not a baked mac. But it was REALLY greasy. I know that mac can be that way depending on the cheese you use. Mine had a large puddle of grease in the bottom of the monkey dish - however  the hubs' didn't. Proof positive that sometimes the grass is greener - or at least less greasy - on the other side of the fence.\\n\\nSauce? Not my favorite. I think it was a home-cooked sauce as it had that shiny cornstarch kind of look maybe - but it was perhaps too cumin-y for my taste and hubs wasn't so keen on it. So maybe that is why they serve it in a teenie cup cause that is enough. I ended up spreading the mac on my meat since I had nothing else.\\n\\nSo now the bill comes. Here's where it gets more interesting. The deal was for 2 dinners with sides and beverages.  The value of the deal was $36.  Our bill came to $28.  The server presents us a bill where we are given $18.95 credit - so we owed $9+. Wait a minute. Let's do that math again. They must have gone thru the Common Core teaching program as in my mind $36 is greater than $28.  In their defense  after I said \\\"\"\"\"no  try again\\\"\"\"\" they decided that we were square. Sigh. What was that all about? Had I not opened my mouth  we would have ended up paying $50 for two $15 dinners plus sodas. Nice markup if you can get it.... here's a novel suggestion: if you are going to run a deal  then figure it out BEFORE your customers get there then teach your servers how to handle them. Don't offer a deal then go - duh  we have no idea what to do with it.\\n\\nI wanted to like this place. Really  I did. We have a meetup group and I am always looking for small businesses that we can intro our members to - but this  sadly  is not one of them. Off in search of local places for our next dinner......\"",

I am a purist and love a good glazed donut so I opted for that. I wanted to try another flavor but to donuts are HUGE and for the price didn't want to throw away a 1/2 eaten donut. The donut itself is very cake-like  the glaze had good flavor and was not overly sweet and the donut was not overly glazed. I took a few bites and left the rest sitting in the car while I ran some errands. A while later I decided to have some more donut and letting it sit in the warm car was the key to donut heaven! After sitting the glaze soaked into the donut and they were both nice and warm.. even the BF agreed it was even better than earlier. I can only imagine what a fresh from the kitchen donut tasted like there  drooling thinking about it.\\nThe prices are higher than a DD or KK  but you are paying for local ingredients  locally made product and not some pre-fab box/bag filled with ingredients you cannot pronounce donut.

We sat at the bar for quite a long time before getting our drink orders filled  more time for our food orders  and our waters were mostly empty. This was all while watching the three or four managers (all dressed  in ridiculous vests and ties with enormous beards) walk around being busy without being productive. Basically  carrying clean glasses from one shelf to another  talking to each other  and never once turning their attention to the customers sat at the bar right in front of them. After awhile  another bartender took over and she was really great. She talked to us for quite awhile and made us feel welcome and appreciated. \\n\\nAs far as the food  I asked for dressing on the side and yet one of the vested/bearded managers poured it on right in front of me. The salad I ordered also came without the two ingredients I was looking forward to (bacon and seasoned croutons). After several minutes of waiting to get the attention of a manager or bartender  they finally noticed me. However  he seemed like he did not believe me that I was missing the ingredients (you don't know your own food?!?)\\n\\nFinally  tonight I took advantage of a Groupon. I ordered a burger  my boyfriend ordered the gravy fries. The food took almost an hour to come out. The burger was okay  fries were semi-cold. But the real problem came when I gave the Groupon to our server. She came back with a bill that the 30 dollars had been taken off of  however it was the completely wrong bill. I tried to show the waitress and her idea of \\\"\"\"\"fixing\\\"\"\"\" it was to run my card for the original amount (sans Groupon). At this point I was pissed. I had been sitting in this restaurant for almost 2 hours  and wanted to go. When I pointed out her mistake she took the bill back. When I saw her again  instead of bringing me my fixed bill  she was taking the order of the table next to us! Finally  a manager came over who had finally fixed the mistake. He addressed all of his comments to my boyfriend  not me  which pissed me off because I was paying. (At least address both of us if you don't know who's credit card you have in your hand.) After all of this  we weren't even offered anything for our trouble! I honestly couldn't believe it. For a restaurant that obviously views itself as somewhat upscale  its service was completely awful. \\n\\nThird time was not a charm. I doubt this place will be around for long  especially when there are so many quality restaurants/bars in the area. I will not be back again.\"",

So was excited about coming in for lunch and trying some of the food.\\n\\nI ordered the Chicken and Shrimps Silver Noodles. I was in the mood for a nice hearty noodle dish for lunch. This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp  nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts  carrots  cabbage  and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch  al dente  and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me. In Thai Style Noodle House case am FAN. No doubt plan on making it regular lunch spot for me and trying more of the menu.",

The food was great when they first opened  but now it's sliding backwards. The corned beef hash was sooo amazing for a couple of visits  but then even the owner  Peter  said he didn't understand why it started tasting so dry and vinegary. Oh well. We'd just find a new menu item  right?\\n\\nI switched to the skirt steak  which is now a great cut of meat  but they always  and I mean always burn the outside. Too much \\\"\"\"\"char\\\"\"\"\" in that \\\"\"\"\"broil\\\"\"\"\" for either of us. I found myself having to trim a LOT of meat off just to get the black bits off. They taste really bad.\\n\\nSo  today  we went yet again (boyfriend is determined to make this place work  lol) and I just skipped the meat items and had their normally amazing hash browns  their multi-grain toast  and a couple of poached eggs. The hash browns were dry and over done  the toast was fine  and the eggs tasted odd. I think it's the seasoning they now use. Not sure if the green in my eggs was cilantro or parsley  but it's not good for me. I always ask for the eggs poached hard and sometimes they are  or one is  or neither is. lol It's really hit and miss with the food now. And I am finding myself just deciding that I'd rather miss the whole thing.\\n\\nThe food issues are added to the continuing lack of sound buffering on the ceiling or floor or walls. When we first started going back in September when they opened  we cut them the slack all new restaurants should get...they are working things out  right? Yet at Eggstasy  they've got tracks in the ceiling for acoustic tiles  but still no tiles. The cavernous loft layout  plus the House Music (I'm not kidding)  with nothing to absorb the noise makes for one deafening experience. Plus  we were freezing more than usual this morning as it was about 46 degrees outside and they wouldn't turn the heater on  apparently. I asked  and the staff said the owner won't do it  ever. It is hardly a cozy place for breakfast on a chilly day. Our server told us that no matter how cold it's been  the owner insists that their huge wall windows get rolled up by 9 a.m. Yikes. It's a neat feature during the warmer months  but not now. They were trying to do a patio service at the same time. Brrrr!\\n\\nSo  we sat there chilly in a very noisy space  yelling back and forth  with sub-par food. \\n\\nSuch a bummer. This place has potential to be amazing  but it's like they stopped trying.\\n\\nThe one really bright spot left is the staff themselves. ALWAYS cheerful (even the brunette Barbies that seat you. lol) and professional. Sadly  though  that can't make up for chill  noise  and spotty food.\"",

From order to walking out  these business owners know how to treat their customers. \\n\\nA friend of mine was craving legit Greek food when I stumbled upon this Yelp profile and Ninos was conveniently down the street from us. This place is probably in a more remote area of the Biltmore area  along 16th Street. It is a charming house with a good amount of tables inside and some bench tables outside. Our party of 7 were the only patrons at the time  so were served in a timely manner and all our food came out in about 15 minutes which to me is great considering our party and number of orders. I believe our party ordered pretty much every single platter on the menu (gyro  lamb  chicken breast  falafel) and each platter comes with pita bread  salad  rice  AND fries with side of tzatziki sauce for less than $10 each. I had the pleasure of trying each platter (yes  I'm THAT person) and oh my goodness... SO SO GOOD! Every meat has great flavor and every element on the platter is delicious and fresh. \\n\\nHere's what sets Ninos apart: they made a mistake on my order of a gyro plate  or rather they did not hear it. Everyone else had got their food and when I asked if my gyro plate was coming  they quickly apologized and said it was coming up. I then looked at my receipt and realized they did not bill me for it. When I told them it wasn't paid for and not to bother because I had more than enough to share with my boyfriend and parents  they insisted on making my gyro plate at no cost. Of course I gave them a hefty tip - what I would have paid for the gyro plate. They deserved it! And that's not all. They ran out of rice for my platter and in consolation  gave us a hummus appetizer on the house! Needless to say  our entire experience was excellent. They were so generous and attentive - gave us so much more than what we asked for and expected in terms of side sauces  additional pita bread  and drinks. And most importantly  one of THE BEST Greek food joints in Phoenix. Hands down. I definitely will be a regular here. THANK YOU YELP and YELPERS for this successful find!",

        "text": "\"One  two  three strikes  you're out!\\n\\nLet's just talk about last night's dinner:  I really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't working out.  Maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in [Johnny Rockets at Westgate also has this issue] or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold December evening... I like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the \\\"\"\"\"orange sauce\\\"\"\"\"  and unagi sauce on EVERYTHING.  \\n\\nIt wasn't just a few artsy swirls of the \\\"\"\"\"orange sauce\\\"\"\"\" and unagi sauce.  They absolutely drench it.  You can dive in with scuba gear!  Maybe I didn't notice that I wasn't ordering a wide array of items but I swear almost everything I saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.  Eating the Firecracker Jalape\\u00f1os  The Mexican Roll  and The Kamikaze Roll felt and tasted the same to me.  The only real difference between the two rolls was that The Mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon [yes  cooked] and imitation crab while The Kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.  Other than that  it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.  Thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.\\n\\nThe tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamame on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.  Like I said  maybe they do have more variety and we didn't see any but I don't think I'll be back to test this theory.  Portions are pretty generous and you can at least ask for easy sauce but it's your poison if you choose to dine here.  Too many great places to eat to just settle for sauce-drenched-everything.  Service here could also be a little better considering when we went  we were just one of three tables.\\n\\n$27 each [for 2 ppl] including tip for edamame  firecracker jalape\\u00f1os  two rolls  three tacos  and an iced tea.\"",

        "text": "MY RATING HAS TO DO WITH THE SERVICE NOT THE FOOD. THE FOOD WOULD GET 5 STARS EASILY!\\n\\nStarting off positive  the food was excellent! I ordered the Roasted Chili Glaze wings and they were  BY FAR  the best I have ever had! The other guests in my party ordered the Hot  Honey  and Hoppy wings  and the Southwest Americana burger. I tried both of those  and they were delicious. The wings had a nice kick to them without being overwhelming and the burger was the same way. The goat cheese balanced out the gigantic  fried pepper perfectly. QUALITY ingredients and well sized portions. For the food only  I will be visiting again.\\n\\nNow for the reason I gave a 2-star rating. It was a busy afternoon because of the ASU vs U of A game  so I figured service might take a little longer than normal. However  the amount of time we waited and the lack of attention our waiter gave to us was not what it should have been even with it being busy.\\n\\nWe started off ordering beers and that came out to us at a reasonable time. Then our waiter  Scott  took our order. We put in for the wings  burgers  and an appetizer (chips and salsa) to start us off. After 10-12 minutes of waiting I started to look for Scott walking around the restaurant to grab his attention and ask for our chips  but he was no where to be found. And the few times I caught a glimpse of him walking around  he never visited our table. Our meal took about 18 minutes or so to come out  which was fine wit me  but he never gave us our appetizer or even acknowledged that he forgot it. \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes into dinner  one of my guest's wanted a refill for the beer but again  our waiter was no where around. When he finally came to our table about 3 minutes later  another one of my guest's asked for a water (that he forgot to bring from the beginning) and before the guest who wanted a beer could even ask  Scott walked away too fast to even get a word out. By that time  we just had our mind on getting the check. \\n\\nIt took another 10 minutes to get the check processed because Scott hadn't come back to get our check  so we gave it to another waitress to get it done. Overall  we felt like we were the guests shoved into the corner and forgotten about. In my opinion  there were not enough staff working for how many people were there. That could have attributed to the lack of service and minimal attention needed to serve our table.",

He came up and started talking to us about his new place down the street. He was so friendly so we instantly had to check this new place out. What an excellent decision it was! Immediately upon entering I saw the copper mugs and knew they served moscow mules. Tom told us about their house made fig infused vodka for the moscow mules and we quickly ordered 3. Extremely well crafted and absoloutely delicious!! I could have easily down 3 of those! Since we were heading to Haus Murphy's after our cocktails for dinner  we only ordered an appetizer. We ordered the meat/cheese/olive plate and wow oh wow!!! It was only $10 and well worth it. 3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow mules! The staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well. Tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. He showed us the original brick wall towards the back  which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place. The patio wasn't quite finished  but it will be awesome once done! Love the beautiful iron gate! Hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out! Glendale definitely needs a cool place like this! Tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment!!",

If you haven't tried it and don't know the concept here it is: you choose a pizza  salad  or pasta and load it up with any toppings you want for one price. And when I say any toppings I mean any toppings. We got meatball  pepperoni  bacon  ham  onions  jalape\\u00f1os and olives on our pizza. They had a ton of fresh toppings for the salad... asparagus  roasted red peppers  cilantro  chicken  romaine  mushrooms  apples. I could seriously go on and on. The dressing we got on the salad was a balsamic vinaigrette which was so yummy. Dare I say one of the most delicious o have had in some time? \\n\\nI was worried the pizza would take too long to make but they use a thin crust that they pop into a wood burning type oven and in three minutes  BAM! Your pizza is ready. \\n\\nStaff was friendly and knowledgeable. The price was very reasonable  especially considering that there is no limit to what you can pile on. $7.75 for a pizza  salad  or pasta. \\n\\nWe are thinking about making this our weekly pizza place. Its cheaper than our usual pizza joint and healthier. GIVE THIS PLACE A SHOT!",

Staring outside my work window watching them refurbish this location for the past 6 months got me excited for something new.  I have been 4 times and have told myself never again. This last time (9-7-2014)  I really mean it. \\n\\nOrdering is a weird thing. Since each item has to be placed into the computer  individually the process takes forever. There is no number system when you order. Just one item at a time. This adds up when you have five people in front of you.  They give you a pager after you order. One visit  my pager never went off. The employee walked aimlessly around the restaurant trying to locate the person who ordered it. When she finally found us she asked if we would like for them to make it again because it's cold.  Really?  Why did they ask us knowing its cold?  We said yes   25 seconds later our food was back.  It was apparent they just zapped it in the microwave.   \\n\\nFood.  Food is okay.  Each time I ordered  it came out slightly warm to cold. The \\\"\"\"\"crispy\\\"\"\"\" tacos shells as they call it  is the same exact thing as the hard taco shells you buy from the grocery store and heat in oven-no flavor  dry and stale. The soft tortillas are also store bought/Taco Bell tortillas.  So really the price you pay is not worth it.  They have two flavors of rice; Mexican and cilantro lime rice.  Both tasted like they were microwaved.  The have Latin fried potatoes that also tasted like they were microwaved which are dry and crunchy.  I also decided to get a side of green sauce .75( I think) for a shot glass size cup.  The same size you pump ketchup in at other fast food places.  I felt totally ripped off. \\n\\nI hope management reads these reviews.  They need to change the tortillas and hard shells at the very least. With better options nearby  I won't be surprised if they are closed within a year.  \\n\\nOverall  not worth the price and headache for the wait and stale food.  You're better off spending that money at Garcias down the street  tee pees on Indian school and 40th street or a Filiberto's.\"",

        "text": "I was veeeery excited to try out this restaurant since I had been watching/hearing about the Edgewater's exciting renovations for such a long time  so when a member of my dinner group suggested it  I was delighted. We dined here on 10/11/14.\\n\\nWe valeted our car.  I wasn't even out of the vehicle before I was greeted by a couple of obnoxious drunk guys spouting off at the mouth.  Badgers won that day-gotsta celebrate I guess.\\n\\nWhile one of us checked in our party of 12  the rest of us thought we would get a drink at the bar while we waited.  It was a very makeshift bar-the kind you would find at a very makeshift wedding reception with only a handful of different liquors set out on a table with some wine  no tappers  etc. Thankfully they were ready to seat us before we even got to order... so we proceeded to the table.\\n\\nThe restaurant was comfortable. High ceilings  warm  soft lighting from the well scaled chandeliers hanging above. Obviously the view of the lake was fantastic as the Autumn sun was setting.  Too bad the open kitchen's bright task light kept trying to creep in and ruin my ambiance.  \\n\\nSo back to my pre-dinner cocktail....I love a good old fashioned and quite frankly  was scared to order one after seeing that ghetto bar  but it's what I really had a taste for  so I thought I would exercise due diligence and ask some specific Qs  such as  if they muddle their drinks  etc. After about 30 long minutes  our drinks arrived. Well  the muddling turned out fine  but there were only about four ice cubes in the entire glass. One of my dining companions  Rich B. (see his recent review on 10/12) was kind enough to order me a glass of ice to make it right. Thanks  Rich B!  \\n\\nI ordered the beef heart tartare. Edible  but still some of the worst I've ever had and I pretty much order tartare whenever I see it on a menu.  Chef was a bit heavy-handed on the mustard. \\n\\nI ordered the Filet for my main course-medium rare.  They served it to me somewhere between Medium to medium well. I sent it back and enjoyed the company of my friends while they prepared another for me.  Soon afterward  as my friends were finishing up their meals  the Manager brought me my second steak.  I cut into it to find that it was so rare it was purple.  Mgr said she was hurrying my steak so that I could eat dinner  but I never really ate anything because I obviously sent that one back too. Haste makes waste.   They did ask me if there was ANYTHING on the menu they could get me to right this wrong  but at this point  my friends had finished eating and I had run out of patience  so it's a good thing that bottle of Sauvignon Blanc I ordered went well with my bread and butter dinner. \\n\\nMy husband had the Seared Diver Scallops with Risotto. He wished there were more than three scallops  but the dish was tasty.  Many of our friends ordered the fish and it was horribly overcooked in every case. \\n\\nAs a peace offering to one of us in the group when they forgot to bring out their side dish  they offered a different potato type side dish of baby potatoes encrusted (=coated and rolling around in) salt.  //see picture//  This was perhaps the highlight of the evening and gave us all a good chuckle.  It was something you would expect your four year old to whip up and surprise you with on Mother's Day.  What on Earth was going on back there in that kitchen?!?!\\n\\nNo.  Just no.",

(We use Open Table ALL the time and have NEVER had an issue with their system.\\n\\nWe get there at 7:30.  There were several groups still there  eating and drinking.  But  we were told  \\\"\"\"\"We closed at 7\\\"\"\"\"...\\\"\"\"\"Nobody would have taken that reservation\\\"\"\"\"  and \\\"\"\"\"You must have made the reservation for a California location.\\\"\"\"\"  This lady had such a nasty attitude  we were flabbergasted.  When I told her I made it on Yelp and showed her  she didn't care just said they closed at 7 and that was that.\\n\\nWe turned around and walked out.  It took us half an hour to find a decent place to eat on Christmas Eve  after we just spent 12 hours in our own store with our customers  who we would NEVER talk to or treat this way.\\n\\nBottom line  this lady and Sauce ruined was to be the cap on a long holiday season for us.\\n\\nWe will never come back  and given how many restaurants have come and gone in this location  can't wait to see what's next if this lady and her crew continue to treat people this way.\\n\\nWait....is that the Karma truck I see circling?\\n\\nBy the way  while Yelp refused to do anything to intervene  Open Table would have jumped in  contacted the restaurant and done something to help make it right.  So Yelp  if you want to compete on the Reservation side  take some lessons from Open Table and step up when you have a reservation issue  and not just  \\\"\"\"\"...the restaurant is responsible for maintaining their own schedule and there is no way for us to know when a restaurant is  or is not  open without their input.\\\"",

If you didn't grow up with BBQ  please don't think that what they serve at Pot Liquor is BBQ. Even Famous Dave's is better than this garbage.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was cooked at too high a temperature for too short a time  so the outside was hard and inedible and the fat and connective tissue didn't break down like it is supposed to  making the interior meat also mostly inedible.\\n\\nThey serve what they call \\\"\"\"\"Alabama Sweet Tea\\\"\"\"\". To me  it tasted like unsweetened tea. In the south  sweet tea is extremely sweet. I understand toning it down a little bit for those not used to it  but this was extremely bland. I complained and they brought me another glass from a different batch  but it was the same.\\n\\nTheir sauces have the non-descriptive names of Cue #1 thru Cue #4. I had to ask what they were. I tried all of them and they were terrible. I think #4 was their \\\"\"\"\"Alabama White Sauce\\\"\"\"\". Instead of being a tangy thin white sauce that can penetrate down into the meat  it was basically 98% mayonnaise with a little bit of seasoning. Disgusting.\\n\\nThey couldn't get basics right  and most of the rest of the menu consists of inappropriate fancy modifications of southern food.\\nExamples include:\\n\\\"\"\"\"Fried Catfish Benedict\\\"\"\"\": Fried catfish should be able to stand on its own. hollandaise sauce is completely inappropriate.\\n\\\"\"\"\"Devil'd Eggs\\\"\"\"\": topped with deep fried chicken skin. The flavor of the skin completely overpowered the egg.\\n\\\"\"\"\"Brownie Bread Pudding\\\"\"\"\": bread pudding is already very sweet if made correctly and chocolate is not an appropriate flavor combination. Then they serve it with \\\"\"\"\"sea salt vanilla gelato\\\"\"\"\". If you asked for \\\"\"\"\"sea salt vanilla gelato\\\"\"\"\" in a real BBQ place in the south  they would laugh at you and probably throw you out.\\n\\\"\"\"\"Fried Pies\\\"\"\"\": this sounds pretty basic but the description says it is served with \\\"\"\"\"malted anglaise\\\"\"\"\". What the heck?\\n\\\"\"\"\"Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches\\\"\"\"\": sounds pretty straight forward but it comes with strawberry cream gelato. Again with the gelato!\\n\\\"\"\"\"Kansas City Style Burnt Ends\\\"\"\"\": Another staple. But they shake \\\"\"\"\"sugar in the raw\\\"\"\"\" over the top. The burnt ends were good but the sugar made the experience unpleasant. Really? You can put sugar on meat that shouldn't have it but you can't put it in your sweet tea?\\n\\nI told them their chef needs to visit Alabama and learn how to make real southern food. They assured me that he HAD visited Alabama and spent a whole 10 days there. You can't learn BBQ in 10 days. Good BBQ chefs have spent well over 10 years learning to make it. Pot Liquor does not serve southern BBQ or any southern dishes. I may try them again in a couple years if they haven't gone out of business. Perhaps by then they will have found a cook book and learned to make some actual southern food.\"",

Here is my take.\\nThe food is reasonably priced for Las Vegas BBQ  which is to say  unreasonably priced anywhere else  but thats par for the course here.\\n\\nThe meat is all smoked in a real smoker that uses real wood  I've seen the smoker  you can see the wood piled around the restaurant.   The pork seems like good pork (though I'm not a huge fan of pork)  the brisket was very tender and flavorful  which IMO means its a shame that they don't have more beef products  I bet they'd be great.  \\n\\nSo what I've had thus far.\\nBacon Steak - Uncured  its like a pork loin.  Its \\\"\"\"\"good\\\"\"\"\"  but I prefer cured bacon.\\nHot Links - Excellent.  The herbs taste \\\"\"\"\"bright\\\"\"\"\"  probably freshly made there.  Not  spicy  I'd say a 5 or less  I can't perceive heat below a 7 at this point  but another person at a table said it had a \\\"\"\"\"kick\\\"\"\"\"  thus my impression that its a 5.  It was a very \\\"\"\"\"different\\\"\"\"\" flavor  some might not like it  but I say give it a chance.\\nMac & Cheese - I don't eat it  but everyone else seemed to love it.\\nPot Pie - The pastry is puff pastry in an interesting latticework pattern floating on top of the chicken soup.  The chicken soup is amazing  the puff pastry is puff pastry (blandish).\\nSweet Potatoes - Interestingly served with lemon zest giving it a citrusy freshness that I disliked and everyone else really loved.  They put marshmallow cream on top and toasted it  which I now do on my own sweet potatoes  but I leave out the lemon zest.\\nBrisket Hamburger - This was amazing  a very generous portion of brisket  a great tasting hamburger  good bun.  Really tasty.  I ate my leftovers cold the next day and was yummy.\\nFrench Fries - Yummy thick cut french fries.  Not necessarily fancy  but seemed fresh (but none of the burnt starch problem like a lot of fresh fries  which I like.\\npork ribs of various types - nice amount of meat  smokey flavor  its pork  probably good.\\n\\nFor dessert  we've had the pumpkin fried pies and had brownie bread budding.  My friend loved the brownie bread pudding  but IMO it was overly toasted  with a slightly burnt flavor.  My friend likes burnt brownies so whatever.\\n\\nSo in the end  I didn't love the place as much as I do Lucilles.  Its not an apples & apples comparison  Pot Liquor doesn't have baked potatoes nor beef ribs  two of the most ordered things I get at Lucilles.  Pot Liquor made me go outside of my box for a lot of things  which is interesting and revitalizing.  My friends might want to go a lot  they seemed to like the flavors more than I did.  \\n\\nI would like to experience beef ribs here  and I'd like to try the brownie bread pudding again to see if they intentionally make it that dark.\"",

I was thrilled when there wasn't a huge crowd for the holiday. It smelled delicious upon entry  and my expectations were pretty high. \\nThere was a beautiful chandelier made from musical instruments that was a perfect decor for the atmosphere they were going for. Jazzy  blues  Bbq  bar yet family style type of place. The staff was friendly  and seemed to already have regular customers as they recognized numerous guests. \\nMy family ordered three appetizers; pork rinds  deviled eggs  and burnt ends. The deviled eggs came with a chicken skin crisp crumble over the top and added a spectacular crunch. The pork rinds were basic but good. And the burnt ends were the first thing gone on the table. We were also presented a sauce sampler with four different styles of sauce to pair with your meat. The first  a sweet classic barbeque sauce. The second was similar to the first  but more spicy than sweet. I would have preferred more spice actually. The third was a cider vinegar they suggest you try with pork. I enjoyed it  the vinegar was not too overwhelming. And then my personal favorite  the white sauce. They describe this as  mayo  horseradish  and seasonings. Don't pass up on the random white sauce  its freakin' great! \\nFor our entree we went with a Lord Have Mercy platter. The waitress insisted that with all this meat  between the four of us  we would most likely have leftovers. (Note: myself  my bf  our kids ages 17 & 12) The entree included:  1/2 smoked chicken  6 baby back ribs  6 dry rubbed spareribs  Carolina pulled pork  4 Louisiana hot links and three sides. Let's just say  we were stuffed  yet our waitress was indeed impressed. Everything had a real smoked flavor. No shortcuts used with this BBQ. \\nI also got an order of the breakfast brisket hash  because for $20 it came with unlimited Bloody Mary's  so that was a deal in itself! This is usually a weekend brunch special  but they were offering it because of the holiday. The bloody was great  I had 3 of them  and was feeling it towards the end. \\nDon't ask me how we ate dessert  but we did. I felt like a family of food critics trying everything on the menu  the kids did great. We had the deep fried banana split (huge and awesome) and the strawberry shortcake sandwiches. Just get those  don't even ask  just do it. \\nDuring our meal  the general manager Francis stopped by our table to ensure satisfaction. Although he was a Cowboys fan  we set aside our football differences and he gave us a coupon for 10% off  that we were able to use that day. The waitress even let us keep the coupon  which is cool because we totally will be returning to this place.",

Next out was the pot pie. Not a traditional looking pot pie. It had a lattice  pattern crust just laying on top. The crust was very buttery  so much so it over powered the rest of the flavors in the pie. The veggies were a disappointment as well. Tasted and looked as if they were from a can of veggie medley. \\n   Now the good news  a gentleman (who I assume was the manager) came to ask how my meal was and I told him. He told me how they were planning to take the pot pie off the menu for some of the reasons I had described and replaced my pork rinds with the Grilled Bacon appetizer. Now that was amazing! Think cut bacon steaks with a jalape\\u00f1o jelly that had just the right kick and a slaw of pickled cucumbers and carrots. That made up for my entire meal. And the fact the management was concerned enough to ask about my meal because he didn't see me touching the pork rinds let me know they care about their food.

Its no hassle parking (structure extremely close by)  not overly cramped seating  and a great looking place.  One extremely important PSA for this place is the FOOD IS AWFUL.  Not that I expected anything special  but for those hoping of having a meal there think more airplane or microwave meals than actual food (for 10-13 dollars a \\\"\"\"\"dish\\\"\"\"\").  With that being said this is a comedy club and not a restaurant so that's why I dont hold that to my rating.  Special shout out goes to Kathleen the audience member rocky loved for this particular show.\"",

I was surprised how unorganized the front seemed there was like 5 hostesses and guest waiting everywhere even blocking the entrance and exit and the staff running around like chickens w/ their heads cut off. (Get it together  you should know it was going to be slammed)  A positive was that they have a text feature so you can go shop and walk around and they'll send you a text when your table is ready. The calamari was delicious   the Lobster pasta was really good and the 100% grass feed burger was ok. I waited about 20 mins for my Appetizer  I ordered bread and it didn't even come out until my food arrived. Like really? \\n\\nI'm almost positive that the reviews that gave 5 stars for the opening weekend are either workers and/or family of workers because that place was chaos and definitely NOT 5 star material. Some of the reviews even sounded scripted. It does have good potential though. \\n\\nManagement: Even when stressed your staff needs to smile. The front needs to be more controlled it was a mess and the hostesses looked annoyed when asking how much longer. Service was slow. Super busy weekend should have been expected and planned for.",

They put your first and last name in the system then give you a waiting pager. They seemed so unorganized like they didn't know what they were doing. The wait was an hour long so we decided to walk around downtown summerlin and check it out.. About 40 minutes passed by so we checked to see how much longer. They said about 4 more people were in front of us still so we waited some more.... About 15 more minutes passes by so we check how much longer again and she said 2 more people were still ahead of us but since we were in there she'll just seat us. I don't know if that was a good or bad thing because if she let us cut in front of people imagine how many people she let cut in front of us?! \\n\\nSo now that we're seated let me say... She gave my boyfriend and I the WORST table. It was so tiny right in between the bar and the bigger tables. We were so close to the family sitting on the side of us. The space was so tight the servers were having a hard time squeezing through to drop off and pick up food. \\n\\nNow for drinks I ordered a white sangria. Our server bragged about how delicious and popular that drink was and how I'm gonna love it...... Then he comes back and says they're all out!!! Really?! Got my hopes up! So I went with the blueberry lemonade.. It was good-- super minty from the mint leaves. My boyfriend just got a Stella.. Nothing to mess up there. \\n\\nAs for food.. The menu was on the pricier side. Their pastas ranged from 20-30$... 18$ for some Mac n cheese!!! They have a sushi side of the menu too but I didn't order any sushi. My boyfriend got the crave burger and the fries tasted over-cooked. The food was just okay. \\n\\nMainly went to check out the new mall and decided we'll stop by and eat there and it was just bad. They are the only restaurant open right now so I understand that's why they were so busy but they just seemed  so unorganized. Probably will give them another shot again like later later once they figure themselves out.",

So  imagine my surprise when I sat down with my extended family  for a birthday dinner for my aunt  and the waiter flat out refused to serve me one of the salads on the menu without dressing and a side of olive oil and vinegar. I did not ask for a dish to be prepared differently  only to not have salad dressing.

Fifty! \\n\\nYou see ... it was either agree to fifty a day or wait for four or more hours for a car. And this was some other company -- one that was never named -- that this Thrifty employee was referring me to. Paraphrasing here: \\\"\"\"\"If you walk up right now  it would be eighty a day. I can get your fifty because this is my friend and I will be sending you to them.\\\"\"\"\" Later  she repeated this line  but mistakenly estimated the walk-up rate now to be ninety (90)  because of \\\"\"\"\"Spring Break.\\\"\"\"\" You can't make this shit up. \\n\\nAfter I say no  politely  I sit for about five minutes or less -- no bullshit -- and  the same employee tells me to head back to the counter because they had my car. The 15$/day car. My untested hypothesis is that it was there all along. \\n\\nIt had Colorado plates and was filthy  inside and out. I turned it in cleaner after the weekend than it was when dispatched to me.\"",

        "text": "\"RAISING THE MOVIE THEATER EXPERIENCE UP TO THE GALAXY \\n\\n  Remember the days when the movie theater was an ordinary experience? It seemed that a few years ago the movie theaters were small  it was hard to see in front of you  and the screen was a super-sized version of the flat screen TV. The Regal Downtown Summerlin Stadium 5 raises the movie theater experience to the next galaxy. \\n\\n  My brother and I had been hanging out in downtown Summerlin. The mall will see better days ahead. At the time of our visit  the majority of the restaurants and stores were not in business. After walking around Macy's  Dillards  and Downtown streets  the idea hit me to go to the movies. \\n\\n  As soon as we stepped inside the Downtown Summerlin Stadium 5  we entered the movie theater of the future. The ticket counter barricade is nonexistent. As soon we walked inside I saw a lobby of plush seating and tables surrounded by a bar  concession stand  and a ticket counter. I could just walk off a downtown Summerlin Street to pick up a cocktail and hang out. The truth is that with the scarcity of nightlife and bars in downtown Summerlin at the time of this review  this is a decent spot to drink a Cosmopolitan  Long Island Ice Tea  or cocktail. We weren't here for drinking. We were here to see a movie. \\n\\n  The movie ticketing counter is to the right of the lobby. On our visit their were two lines to purchase tickets for any of the five movies playing. If we were undecided about a movie  there was a sheet explaining what the movies were about. Once we decided  the friendly woman at the counter showed us the monitor displaying the available seats. Just like the Galaxy Theater chain that has revolutionized the Las Vegas movie theater scene  the seats here are assigned. This reminded me of my recent review on the Oriental Theatre in Chicago where you get assigned seats. The adult ticket price on a Sunday afternoon is $13.A bit pricey but you live once. But if we saw the matinee the ticket price would be around $10.\\n\\n  Now my eyes were on the concession stand. I love complimenting my movie experience with crunchy nachos with cheese and a large Coke. The Nathan's hot dog looked kind of good. But not tonight. The Downtown Summerlin Panda Express had filled me up. So  I'd compliment my movie theatre experience with a large Coke that came out to $6.50. The large Coke was refillable. After the movie I'd refill it for the walk back to Red Rock Casino Resort. If I wanted a sugar free Coke I could order Diet Coke or Coke Zero. \\n\\n  To the left of the bar is where you present the ticket to the woman standing there. Beyond the ticket gate was a small corridor attaching the five stadium seating theaters. \\n\\n The theater brought comfort up to the next galaxy. This was stadium seating on steroids. The space between rows was a mutant space where a professional wrestler could extend his legs out and they'd still be room for a person to walk by. And the seats. When I sat on the leather seat  I felt like I was in a LincolnTown Car. These seats make the typical theatre seats passe The soft to the touch leather seats included drink holders  what looks like arm trays and a button that reclines the seat up so that you are practically lying back watching the movie. The stadium seating alleviated any blind spot if a tall person were to have sat in front of me. \\n\\n  One thing that hasn't changed is the coming attractions. Regardless that the start time of \\\"\"\"\"To Kill the Messenger\\\"\"\"\" was 5:10 pm  the coming attractions ended at 5:27 pm. \\n\\n  The movie screen was Academy Award Winning. The detail of the screen with the surround sound brought me a galaxy away from downtown Summerlin. But when you are relaxed and surrounded by comfort times goes fast. \\n\\n  As I walked toward the streets of Downtown Summerlin  I had a positive feeling  that the movie theater has made a comeback. This is a comeback that I have read about in the reviews for Galaxy Theaters  the innovators of the Las Vegas luxury movie theater scene. It is a comeback that encourages me to comeback to the newest luxury theatres for an Academy Award Winning movie theater experience.\"",

This place is in the strip mall where Naga and the yogurt place is. \\n\\nWhat I'm loving here are the non meat options that I had so far. \\n\\nSay yes to Eggplant Salad! Warm eggplant on bed of salad greens sprinkled with seasonings and almond slivers. The small size bowl was filled up plentiful of eggplant and perfect serving size for lunch.\\n\\nMy other favorite; the Vegetarian Combo Platter. It had many of my Greek and Middle East favorites Baba Ganoush Hummus Grape Leaves  Falafel  and seasoned flat bread.  I enjoyed this dish! Although the hummus doesn't measure up to Bon Chef Cafe's version (I so miss Chef Ash!)\\n\\nThe Zatar seasoning that chef makes and uses in a lot of the dishes here is awesome!!! It was meticulously sprinkled on each slice of my flatbread. I had to comment and ask what's the deal with the spice blend he used because it's different from the Greek and Middle Eastern places I've been to. I learned from Chef Manny that his spice blend included thyme sesame seeds  and ..I forget..but whatever it is  I was diggin it! Also he said he uses mint leaves and mentioned that he used it in the Eggplant Salad that I had couple weeks ago..(whoa dude remembered me??... xtra cool point!!!). I have to note from talking with him  he really takes pride in what he makes. I so appreciate that it's all made from scratch. \\n\\nThe Shrimp Kebab was also delish. A little confused though as to why it wasnt on a skewer. No biggie. It's nice that you can order it ala carte. And you can order the Beef  Chicken and Lamb kebabs too ala carte. \\n\\nThe only thing I wasnt too crazy about is the Tzatziki sauce...I want to say it's sour cream based. Kinda bland and consistency was just too thick and rich for my taste. It's all good though because the spices used in the gyro meat made up for it. But still a tad disappointing. But with the many menu choices that there are I can live without it. \\n\\nThey did a great job renovating the dining area. Smart use of space seating wise. Seems like a few more tables added than the previous tenants. (Fix8  Cino's  Lucca Deli)  Big plus to the TV  playing sports channel. I caught part of the baseball playoffs when I had a dinner break here.(Yay Giants!) \\n\\nPrice for lunch I found reasonable. It's fast/casual dining. Order at counter and they'll bring your food out to you. Service was good.  I found the staff pretty friendly and was impressed that Chef remembers his customers. The times I was there  there were quite a few regulars already coming and going to this fairly new place. Easy going dining experience. Ive got no major issues. For sure in my lunch/dinner rotation.

I am generally not a fan of vegetables disguising themselves as fries  but these are amazing.  Also  I am generally not a fan of $10.00 burgers and was pre-disposed to not like this place.  However  the burgers here are phenominal.  We can usually split one burger and one side (usually the green chile fries  but sometimes we venture out and try one of the others) and it is plenty for two of us (this is in addition to the aforementioned Zucchini fries  of course).  Our favorites are the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple (I even splurged once and got the Kobe style Plain and Simple - it was very good  but not good enough to justify the extra cost on a regular basis).  The onions on the Zinburger are braised in Zinfandel and very tasty.  Although I have not tried the Turkey burger  I have been told by several folks that have tried it that it is the best one they have tasted.  Flavorful and juicy.  \\nYou should always find out what the burger of the day is - we have had some pretty amazing ones.\\nThe shakes are also phenominal (although I prefer beer  I have tasted at least six different flavors of shakes and they were all outstanding).\\nThe staff is great.  Very pleasant and generally attentive.  We did have one incident where our server apparently walked oof after taking our drink orders  but once the management was made aware they were on top of it immediately (and stayed on top of it throughout our stay).  The management staff is very friendly and they are always walking around checking things out and making small talk with the patrons.\\nAll in all  for a higher end burger place  this is a very good choice (we can usually get out for under $30.00 for the two of us if it isn't Happy Hour - even less during HH).

The hotel is jammed packed with children walking the same areas no one is in the casino so why can't we go to the restaurant?  No children must wait outside. It's in the 30s and we are guests seriously? .  Husband runs back like no no I won't gamble  we'll just walk on. No children need to go outside. That's where I'm about done . I ask him if he realizes we are guests and it's freezing and since hubs is there he's is like oh no you can walk on. Seriously ?? I go to management and yep his name was Carlos Santana (total double take) he agrees it's cold and if the kids were able to move on it shouldn't be a problem. But outside is completely illogical especially when it's cold. Regardless this place has left a bad taste in my mouth. The amount of people complaining before me should have given me a clue at the quality of service.  Staying at the Cosmo",

It's a loud freaking noise like they are digging or drilling asphalt constantly. It's very loud and annoying. Second  your phone doesn't work In this big building  it's 21th century and phone doesn't work. That's so stupid. Third  if you ask for extra blanket  they only give per person. Their none working Wifi that keeps dropping is limited to two device and for each extra device you have to pay $13... stupid.. If my own phone was working in their vicinity then I had less problem but your phone doesn't work so we used our two device limit for me and my husband's phone so we couldn't even connect our iPads or laptops because was stupid to pay $13.99 box extra for each device... The casino has no good ventilation and it's like you are walking in a smoke room. There is no central air condition unit in the room and it's loud like the one in old motels...Anyhow for the price we paid I could have stayed in a 4 star hotels but we decided to stay here given that it was a newer  built but that was mistake.",

It is billed as farm to table with local  fresh ingredients.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is cozy and quite lovely with fireplaces and stone.  It's located in South Park.  \\n\\nTo be fair  we came on the first Friday they opened. Our server took forever to get us our wine and she didn't know at all what she was doing.  She struggled opening the bottle  and then she poured a rather pricey red way over volume in the first pour.  She had to be prompted to stop pouring -  to the point that we did not get 4 glasses out of the bottle because she poured so much in the first glass.  In terms of wine  they ran out of the first bottle we ordered so we switched our choice only to be told they were out of it.  They were also out of the next bottle we picked.  So  the owner came with a recommendation.  When I asked if it was a similar price point as my previous selection  I was told \\\"\"\"\"of course  we aren't THAT restaurant\\\"\"\"\".  However  when he checked the wine  it was not the correct price point.  He did the right thing by us and discounted it a bit.\\n\\nWe ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Especially the gulf coast ones.  However  I asked for tabasco for them and was told they didn't have any.  Later  the waitress brought green tabasco but that's absolutely not the same. \\n\\nI ordered the arugula and walnut salad and it was perfectly prepared and tasty.\\n\\nThe entrees were a problem.  They were out of my first fish selection so I selected a fish on the menu but requested that they prepare it with an alternate to the fingerling potatoes.  I asked for more beets  a sweet potato instead - basically anything other than the potatoes.  The waitress told me they couldn't do that.  That made no sense to me since the menu had a listing of local farms they are patrons of.  Anyway  I decided on the shrimp and grits.  That was a really bad decision as the shrimp was overcooked  the grits were overcooked to a point of sticking together in a giant clump and the sauce was bland. I ate the shrimp (I was starving) and left the rest.  The owner asked me what I thought of the food and I politely told him it was \\\"\"\"\"ok\\\"\"\"\".  That once again  he needed to have tabasco or some seasoning available (this was a white wine based sauce and didn't have sausage).  He didn't seem interested in my feedback.  On the positive note  my husband had the grouper and thought it was outstanding. \\n\\nThe owner returned with a piece of cheesecake that is his mother's recipe which my husband gobbled down quickly. However  he did not apologize for the experience  thank me for feedback or invite me to return.  I might consider returning but there are better choices in South Park.\"",

The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger  but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out  it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty  hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it  then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries  this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done  I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again.

Been looking to quit smoking and my husband wanted one too. \\nSo  I went to the kiosk they have set up at AZ Mills Mall. I talked to the guy working there. We discussed what would work best for us and talked about prices. The one he was selling me was their most basic model. He told me they are normally $85 but would sell me 2 of them for $80. He said their juices are normally $10 but would sell me some for $5 each. And in the ecigs there is a heating element that needs to be replaced sometimes. I wanted to get a bunch of those since I have to send my husband his ecig overseas and wanted him to have plenty and not run out. So he told me since I was buying in bulk he would give them to me for $2.99 each instead of $5.99 each. \\n\\nI purchased the stuff  totaling out to $120.00. \\n\\nThe next day  I decided to check out their website to see if they had any different liquids there that they didn't have at the kiosk. I see my ecig I just purchased and clicked on it to see what other colors they had that they didn't have at the kiosk. AND TO MY SURPRISE  they were only $20 a piece on the website. Yes  you read that right. He charged me DOUBLE the price that they sell it for online. This is a LOCAL  SMALL company. I completely understand being able to purchase some things cheaper online and the convenience of being able to view  touch and check a product out in person. But DOUBLE the price????? The liquids are only $5 online and the heating elements are only $1.99.

I ask to speak to a manager.  I get Frank on the phone and I tell him my situation.

You are the manager  same company  etc. He told me online you are buying wholesale and this is retail. Um. Bullshit. But ok. So I asked him if I should call the online customer support. Again  very  very rudely he replies \\\"\"\"\"You can do whatever you want.\\\"\"\"\" WOW! I then proceeded to tell him how much he sucks at doing his job. \\n\\nSoooooo  I call the main phone number listed on the website. *Ring  ring....* \\\"\"\"\"Hello?\\\"\"\"\"  Yes  a company listing this number online for a business answers the phone Hello  not the company name. So I asked if this was Vapor Tech  he tells me yes. So  I proceed to tell him about being charged double  blah  blah. He explains that online  you don't get a lifetime warranty and at stores you do. So  I get charged double the price because I get a lifetime warranty? A lifetime warranty for a company that most likely won't be around that long  but ok. \\n\\nNow  here's the real kicker. So  online you can buy 2 of those ecigs for $40. But I paid that price for 1 because I get a lifetime warranty  right? WELL  the funny part is  if you try to use that lifetime warranty  there is a restocking fee of $19.99. So  for $60  I could buy 3 ecigs online  but instead  I get 1 at the kiosk for $40  then if it breaks I have that awesome lifetime warranty  but I have to pay $20 restocking fee???????????????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \\n\\nSo  continuing  this guy I'm talking to is the owner of the company. And then I tell him about his rude manager at the kiosk. Yeah  he doesn't give 2 shits. He tells me if I buy any liquids online to let him know and he'd throw a few bottles in there free for me. Yeah  I'm gonna go ahead and call BULLSHIT right now. If he wanted to resolve the situation  he would have asked for my address right then and shipped some stuff to me. \\n\\nHORRIBLE  SCAM  PRICE GOUGING  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!\"",

        "text": "\"I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world  the manager Louise  and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part  so if you're just looking for a place to sleep  you'll be happy. \\n\\nLet's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time  2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel  they called the hotel and they said that \\\"\"\"\"he didn't show up for work\\\"\"\"\" but if they took a cab  they would be reimbursed. Well  that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam  but the shuttle bus driver said he \\\"\"\"\"might be to busy to take us\\\"\"\"\". Ummm  isn't that your job? I mean  to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there  I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!! \\n\\nNext up  breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel  as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast  have enough food. Every single day  our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons  biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole)  cinnamon rolls  bananas  pancake batter  sausage  bacon  eggs  etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup  the same stuff that they were running out of  was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless. \\n\\nThe pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was  but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there  that's how disgusted I was. \\n\\nI booked 4 King rooms  but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms. Again  very disappointed that we all didn't get the rooms that were originally booked.  \\n\\nUmmm yeah... Sadly I won't be staying here again. Besides Louise  everything was a huge fail in my book.\"",

Fake caterpillar roll had no flavor along with sex on the beach which tasted like rice vinegar that overpowered the whole roll. Salmon sashimi was not cut correctly  it was cut like the crab sticks which detracted from its presentation and flavor. Burning sensation roll with soft shell crab  avo  and tuna was swimming in a garlic ponzu and for some reason here was a heaping mound of rice on my plate. Overall not impressed and won't be back.

The \\\"\"\"\"best of both\\\"\"\"\" was mediocre at best.

I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual   after Guy leaves   things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse  the price had been increased to $11.

So  I was really thankful to visit on a weekday  when I didn't need to wait for seats  and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost  it's right next to Johnson Public House  and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\\n\\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers  make your own pizza  specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also  there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \\n\\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs  bacon  cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND  how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy  rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust  though not italian thin  but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\\\"\"\"\"/$14 pizza was so big  we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\\n\\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..)  the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth!

What a warm  lively  fun  creative and delicious way to spend a chilly Sunday night! \\nI'm going to try to write this review without using too many exclamation marks  but that'll be a challenge. \\nDanielle  the glowing hostess  was on fire in the kitchen! I mean  she whipped up individual stir fry plates for every single guest (and there were a lot of us)  hot and beautifully presented. And  THOSE PEANUTS. Seriously - I don't even really like peanuts but I was even grabbing a handful on my way out the door despite being already painfully full. Where were they from again?? Also  it'd been a while (like many  many years) since I'd had tempeh  and I now feel like I've been missing out! I'm definitely going to go back to check out Noble Bean  our tempeh supplier for the night  housed just upstairs from Cuisine Culinaire. Who knew?! Now we do. \\nInstead of waiting in line for stir fry  I decided to go to dessert first and sample some of the cookies brought in for the swap... and really didn't even know where to begin with those... There were sooooo many good cookies and such a variety. Thankfully I had my partner with me so that I could just take a bite of one to sample it and hand off the rest to him to finish for me. Ha! Cookies for days. What a FABULOUS idea to have a cookie swap. Everybody got to leave with something. :)\\nNow  Cuisine Culinaire is one of over a thousand community kitchens in Quebec  so we were told  and this blows my mind! Quebec wins! It's really good to know about this place  and I hope they have a website  because it would be awesome to go back for a cooking class sometime!",

It was nothing spectacular and there weren't fireworks on my tongue haha I have gone to the one in central park in new york and I remember that one being real good. So  I was very excited when I heard one had opened here! \\n\\nWhen I looked at the menu  it was similar to that of new york. The average price of a burger is 6-10$. The shakes are around 5$. When I had arrived  I was expecting some what of a line but I seriously just walked right on up to the register and ordered our burgers. Some of the burgers have a shack sauce that reminded me of in n out  but this sauce is much saltier than I remember. Nothing beats the in n out secret sauce  \\n\\nOverall  the burgers we got basically tasted like something  that I could have concocted at home. Just cook some meat  fry some bacon  melt some cheese and voila! You have a shake shack burger. The sauce was salty and I felt it had overpowered the taste of my burger. I had to drink two cups of Dr pepper to help with it. The krinkle fries were good tho! You can't mess up potatoes!

Highlights:\\n\\n- $10 unexpected parking fee \\n\\n- Before we entered we were told by staff that food or drinks were not allowed on the premises  \\\"\"\"\"No exceptions.\\\"\"\"\" I learned that  actually  both were allowed  but only if you paid for them inside. When we did purchase food and drinks ($40 worth)  we were never advised that we could not proceed into other domes with said food and drinks.\\u00a0 At dome 3  the staff told us we had to throw away everything \\u00a0 which included the souvenir cups  before we could proceed (it's worth noting the concession stand is RIGHT NEXT TO dome 3). \\n\\n- The work I put in to pre register for the event (a laborious task due to a poor Web experience) was useless because the kiosks to activate/link profiles to your provided band didn't work. Also  I learned from a manager that the wristbands that were sent to AZ were not the ones they originally tested the experience with.  The wristbands did not work at all \\u00a0 and they we're eventually taken away from us by staff outside the level 3 dome because \\\"\"\"\"they're vey defective \\\"\"\"\" as one employee told me. \\n\\n- Staff activated each interactive game with random bands (I guess some actually worked?)...But this seemed to cause issues with the sensors that read body height; all but one of the games functioned poorly.\\n\\n- None of the 3D features worked \\u00a0 and we were told they would not work until Tuesday (3 days after our purchased event date). Very upsetting considering 3D features were advertised as part of the Marvel Experience. \\n\\n- Waiting times to enter domes were extreme (it took our group 40 minutes to enter the the Level 3 dome because the staff said they were fixing technical issues). Another 30 min for the 4D. Btw  why was it considered 4D if I'm watching a 1D movie on a big screen (no 3D glasses here)  while sitting on a motion seat? \\n\\n- At the end of the event \\u00a0 I was asked by a staff member how was my experience.\\u00a0 I gave my candid feedback and his reply literally was \\u00a0 \\\"\"\"\"Well  at least you didn't pay $180 bucks per ticket like some other people.\\\"\"\"\" Because...that's supposed to make me feel better? \\n\\n- Sidebar: Is it just me or did I not see one piece of merchandise in the shop that featured a female character (even though they were featured in the videos throughout the experience). Male characters only for sale. That doesn't seem very balanced.\\n\\n- Further frustrated   I asked who is on site to manage the whole experience.  I was told it depends... There's someone managing VIP  food  tickets   and technology.  I asked for anyone who can make changes.  Strangely   they send me to the ticketing manager.  When I provided my feedback I learned: no one really knows who or to what extent staff was trained (some staff admitted to me they hadn't been thru the experience)  the wrong bands were sent to AZ  there isn't time for anything to fix things because \\\"\"\"\"we go from 9 am to 11 pm everyday and there's no time to figure anything out \\\"\"\"\" AZ was more of a \\\"\"\"\"test ground \\\"\"\"\" and the 3D won't be fixed until Tuesday   after someone is flown in to fix it. \\n\\n- If you want a refund (I'm sure you will)  I learned you have to request it through TicketMaster.\\n\\nBoo.\"",
