I usually do my gel nails at home  but thought I'd give myself a treat by going here.  Wrong.  I could have done better than Lien.  My fingernails were filed crooked  as were one of my toenails -- if I hadn't noticed and had Jenny straighten it out.  Very unhappy with the service here.  Groupon or not  I will NOT go back.",

        "text": "\"Possibly the first AND last time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \\\"\"\"\"The Box Combo\\\"\"\"\" which included 4 chicken strips  cole slaw  fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods  I pulled over  parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............\\n\\nChicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes  my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \\\"\"\"\"off\\\"\"\"\".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped  but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!\\n\\nFries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.\\n\\nCole Slaw- Didn't try it.\\n\\nTexas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice  I would have done it.\\n\\nSoda- Coke Zero tasted a little \\\"\"\"\"off\\\"\"\"\".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.\\n\\nSauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.\\n\\nService in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh  right?  We shall see................\"",

We both split the Seared Scallops and the Pear and Endive Salad. Both were excellent. Giant Scallops! We ordered the Aged New York Strip and  Aged Rib Eye. Ordering a rib eye 'blue' may have been a mistake. The steak knife had trouble cutting the meat. Do yourself a favor and order the Chimichurri sauce. It is delicious. I ordered a side of Asparagus which I wish would have been a little larger pieces. \\n\\nWe ordered the swan for desert. The swan is a little ridiculous. It is basically a giant creme puff with ice cream. I would recommend a different appetizer. \\n\\nWe had a couple drinks as well and the bill came out to a modest 150.

I noticed a problem around the beginning of August with Algae growing and let her know. After some research  i learned that algae growth is likely from the pool no longer being shocked each week.  The following week  I was home when she came  she didn't bring a brush and the only thing she did was throw a few tabs into the chlorine dispenser and left!! That is not maintaining a pool.  As the algae issue grew  we went ourselves and purchased a brush to try and get the pool cleaned and let her know again the issue was there and getting worse.  At the same time the pump was not working correctly (to us - we are new homeowners and are still learning how the equip. works).  I exchanged a few text messages with Susan letting her know  she was going to come check it and she suggested she come show us how it all works to which I replied yes.  I also checked again when I got home that night and it was still not working  so I let her know and never received a response and no one ever came to look at it.  The following week  the same problem.  No one had been to the house to clean the pool  so I texted her letting her know I wanted at least half of my money back for August since they had not done their job.  No response.  The next day I went to put in tablets that I purchased and noticed that someone had been to  our house and put tablets in - but again didn't do anything else.  No one even showed up the last week of the month.  I have yet to receive my refund  and I will be going to the authorities at this point.  I would not recommend at all.  We are now having to pay someone to come clean our pool  do an entire re-evaluation of the equipment and fix the leak on the pump that was supposed to have been fixed by Seablu twice already.",

My girlfriend ordered the Salmon which she actually got to decide how it was prepared which was very nice. It was very fresh and flavorful! I ordered the filet mignon with a pimento cheese crust.

Upon walking into the restaurant  expectations were high since the decor is notably more modern than the usual Chinese restaurant ambience and currently residing in Henderson  I was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards Spring Mountain.  From start to finish  I'd have to say the quality of the dim sum was consistently meh.  My mom  dad  and sister joined me and I found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all four of us consistently in unanimous agreement.   \\n\\nTemperature: a marker of good quality (and signs of active turnover) is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.  Virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival  and even after we requested a fresh one or that they reheat a dish  it came back lukewarm at best.  \\n\\nTexture: The daikon cakes were gelatinous and missing the crispy edges  the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked  and the shrimp dumplings (the benchmark for dim sum) had skins that were gummy.  Even the salt and pepper squid (pretty much a staple at any Chinese restaurant) was coated in a dark brown batter that resembled the KFC extra crispy batter rather than the air-y tempura batter that barely coats the the natural contours of the squid pieces.\\n\\nService: My sister and I had a recent discussion regarding the rise of Korean and Japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of Chinese food.  One of the things which are done well in the former two is service and it's almost an anticipated assumption that any decent Chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverware/plates since as a cultural whole  neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a Korean/Japanese restaurant.  Folks here seem apathetic and inattentive  which is all the more surprisingly considering the grand opening was within the past few weeks.\\n\\nMy mother  who usually can be quite forgiving towards Chinese food  summed it up best (paraphrased from Chinese):\\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"If our friends ever invite us to this place  I will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid coming back\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThere's dim sum  and then some....and this is definitely the latter.\"",

And then while the cart was circulating on the dining floor  a kitchen staff in a chef's hat placed several dishes of Chinese broccoli on top of the second level of rice noodle thus creating 3-levels of food on top of each other in a pyramid fashion! I wished I got a pic of what I saw.",

The food was bland and they offered to heat the noodle dish they served to us. They came back with it and it was still COLD. The fried squid was very mushy and tasted a little bitter. Dumplings were probably the best thing to eat there. Oh and you have to ask like 5 people to bring you rice. I wouldn't want to come back here.",

It used to be a rather sleazy dive  was promptly bought and has become the only competitor to everyone's favorite furniture store for Scandinavian food. Slight modification: Ellefsen is Norwegian(-style) rather than swedish.\\n\\nThe decor is lovely:pastel tones and wooden surfaces  the menu is written on blackboards (isn't that the new hip thing of the moment or what?). It's a a bit european-clich\\u00e9 but i'm totally buying it anyway. Their specialty is the smorrebrod (with dashed o's)  a typically Scandinavian open-sandwich on rye bread  or rather a slice of bread  if you're a \\\"\"\"\"glass-half-empty\\\"\"\"\" kind of person. Their slection is astounding: squash  salmon  caviar  quails (?!!!). Ellefsen brings together chic cuisine in a caf\\u00e9 setting! I've had some excellent Elk bavette. Last time I went  they even offered horse bavette! Chanterelles also seem a staple of the menu. If you'd like to stay a bit closer to Quebec  try one of their poutines (one with meatballs  the other with cod). Their main dishes are all delicious  although the chef seems to like salt  alot  everywhere  on everything.\\n\\nTheir breakfast earned the european-parents-seal-of-approval: strong black coffee! The muffins and croissants are obviously fresh of the morning  and to die for (take note of the unusual flavours: orange-grapefruit muffins! YUM!). My own favorite is the Ellefsen fruit plate (it's huge! with sour yoghurt and muesli) with a glass of freshly-squeezed juice. Sadly  no desserts! :(\\n\\nWhile I love the food  I'm still unsure of my opinion of Ellefsen. While i was snapping pictures for this review  an older lady randomly asked me: \\\"\"\"\"Is it strictly for students?\\\"\"\"\". And you'd think it's hipster central! Berets  leggings and white laptops galore! The free WIFI is extremely attractive I admit. I've also seen families  but only rarely encounter middle-aged people. Hmmmm. Alright  I'll say it: I'm bugged by the service: sometimes I'll come and the waitress will be at my table ready for my order  other times none of them will budge and after an epic wait  I'll go to the counter and then when I automatically go to the counter they seem surprised.. What to do for a smorrebrod!! Another thing I've picked up on is a discreet but steady rise in prices..\\nRegardless  I love the food  I love the setting and I am back  relentlessly..\"",

Ever. \\n\\nA coworker recommended China Tango a few weeks ago and said it was her favorite Chinese place so I decided to give it a try. I walked in and ordered 1) Hot and Spicy Shrimp  and 2) Beef and Broccoli. The hostess was really nice  polite  and said my food would be ready in 20 minutes. \\n\\n20 minutes later  I was back. My food was ready to go so I paid (thinking it was a little on the pricey side for a non-fancy Chinese place  but figured the food would be worth it based on the recommendation) and was off on my way home. Problem number one  the way they packed the food: two containers of rice on the bottom  hot and spicy shrimp (in a styrofoam container) in the middle  and the beef (in plastic Tupperware container) on top. I made a right turn and the dishes on top toppled over and the shrimp sauce spilled right out (into the plastic bag but still...a mess. And now my car smelled like ketchup. More on that later.). Maybe I should have reorganized the food in the bag Tetris-style but I'm not a huge takeout person so the thought never occurred to me. But it should occur to the people at China Tango  no??? Well  it didn't.\\n\\nThen the food. So bad. So bad. So bad. \\n\\nBeef and broccoli: the beef was rubbery and fatty. Seriously yucky. The sauce was completely bland. The broccoli and carrots were fresh and crunchy but I didn't pay $15 for broccoli and carrots! \\n\\nHot and Spicy Shrimp: shrimp was breaded then tossed with onions and like a whole bottle of ketchup.  Maybe two. Even my daughter asked  \\\"\"\"\"why does the house smell like ketchup?\\\"\"\"\" when I opened up the container.  This was quite possibly the worst dish I've ever had. Setting aside the ketchup for a second  why would you bread shrimp only to mix it in a thick sauce? It ends up being soggy.

For the price  I think it's a pretty good deal. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other pizzas they have.",

        "text": "\"On Friday September 12th I initially came in for a price estimate on 100 000 mile service. Larry Tinnin the service manager greeted me and I requested a cost estimate. He went in the service bays and came back. When he returned he quoted me $800 for 100k mile service on my 09 Touareg and stated the transmission needed to be serviced. I questioned the transmission service  then went to my vehicle to retrieve the owners manual. In the owners manual it doesn't list any transmission service at 100 000 miles. Only DSG transmission at 80 000 miles.  I showed this to Larry and he dismissed his lack of knowledge to \\\"\"\"\"well that's why it is good to have your book\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nLarry in turn had me speak to Alex Harris  a service advisor. Alex walked with me out to my vehicle to retrieve the VIN.(I have had every service on my car performed by Findlay North since this dealership opened.) Alex pulled up the service by the VIN which confirmed I did not need a transmission service. Alex printed out the service and cost. Larry told me Alex would be in on Monday when I wanted to drop off my vehicle.\\n\\nMonday September 15th I came in the morning to drop off my vehicle. Alex wasn't there  instead I was greeted by Daniel Grossardt. Daniel told me that Alex would not be in today. I provided Daniel with the print out of the service estimate Alex had provided. I told him this is what I wanted performed on my vehicle. \\n\\nA few hours later Daniel called me and stated I needed the transmission to be serviced on my vehicle. I provided him with the background conversations I had with Larry and Alex. I stated the transmission service was done during the 80k mile scheduled maintenance. Daniel told me how the transmission was never serviced at 80k miles and I needed to have it serviced now. \\n\\nI was very upset. I asked Daniel to pull up the records on the 80k mile service since it was performed at their dealership. I told him I wanted to know exactly what was done and what I paid for. He stated he looked it up and I had oil change  cabin filter  inspection  and tire rotation for $700. There was never a transmission service. I told him I wanted to speak to the service manager. He stated the manager was unavailable and he would have him call me back. \\n\\nLarry Tinnin called me a little while later. Larry told me the transmission needs to be serviced and it was never serviced at 80k miles. I asked him why not? I brought the vehicle in to his dealership for it's 80k mile service. I paid for an 80k mile service and expected that to be done. Larry argued with me that the 80k mile service was done  but not the transmission and it needed to be done now. When I asked Larry why it wasn't done at 80k he told me that he had no knowledge of the discussions I had with Bruce the service advisor at the time. He stated bruce no longer works there and I may have declined the transmission service he doensn't know. I proceeded to tell Larry I didn't come to the dealership to see Bruce  I came to Findlay VW where he is a manager of the service department and it isn't my problem that Bruce doesn't work there. There is no record of me declining service  becuase I never did. I bring my vehicle to a dealership because I am supposed to trust the dealer to know what I need. I should be able to come in and say \\\"\"\"\"I want an 80k mile service\\\"\"\"\" and they perform the service and charge me accordingly. \\n\\nLarry continued to argue with me and stated the only option was for them to do the service now and how I should trust him that they will do what is needed. I felt I had been ripped off. I tolf Larry not to touch my vehicle  I didn't trust them and I would pick it up after work. Around 6pm I arrived at Findlay North Volkswagen and was greeted by Daniel. Daniel proceeded to tell me  he has good news. The transmission service they had been trying to get me to purchase was for a DSG transmission which my vehicle doesn't have. The reason it never showed up in any records as being performed is because it isn't needed. \\n\\nSo if I wouldn't have questioned the service department on the service history of my vehicle and why they were trying to charge me for this I would have paid over $500 for work that wasn't needed. That would be like going to a Dr and having surgery you didn't need. Findlay Volkswagen has lost all of my trust they built over the years. The lack of knowledge on the product almost led to a significant amount of overcharge for maintenance that was never needed. I can only imagine how many others come in to the service department and end up paying money for service that isn't needed. This is completely inexcusable. I have never received any acknowledgment from the service manager on their mistake. Not only is the service department suffering from a lack of product knowledge  the service manager doesn't have any customer service skills.\"",

Anything else also it took a while to get. A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check  the food was good overall\\nMy experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detail from the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure.",

I went there with my wife on a Groupon and we liked the place so much  we had our second anniversary dinner there.\\n\\nAdmittedly  I haven't tried a lot of the menu.

Making a reservation was very simple and when you pull up the outside definitely does not match the inside.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a resort used  I believe  as time shares.  Once you walk in you feel like you are in a very hip...very upscale spot.  Once you take the corner to the seating area it's a whole new vibe.  It's very Mob sexy with an old \\\"\"\"\"Casino\\\"\"\"\" vibe.  I couldn't stop looking around because of how well put together it is.  The d\\u00e9cor was by far the highlight of my night.\\n\\nI was already hungry so everything on the menu was looking amazing.  The Foie Gras was sold out so I was a little sad.  My boyfriend and I decided to share the lobster and steak because it was recommended for two by our server.  Our girlfriend got the sea bass.\\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and a cocktail.  When our server came back to the table he asked to take our order...AGAIN.  When we told him he was just at our table he apologized.  He brought over water 10 minutes later.  When he came back with our bottle of wine and asked if we knew about the dinner specials this evening...that he already went over when he took our food order.\\n\\nWhen our dishes finally came he decided to ask us to move our plates and glasses that he sat down to lay the tray with the lobster tails and our steak.  It was very awkward and weird.  If your surf and turf platter is bigger than the actual table you may want to evaluate your dishes...or a pop up tray to sit between us.  \\n\\nOur steak was requested medium rare and was presented well done.  Not a big issue for us but when you charge as much as they do and there are literally only 10 tables in the restaurant it shouldn't be an issue.  Meat on both lobster and steak were dry and appetizer portion.  Our girlfriend's sea bass on the other hand was amazing which priced less than my she crab soup.\\n\\nWhen the bill came it was a bit overpriced for the service and quality of food.  I get what they are trying to do and I applaud them but for amateur service and not a great portion or quality of food I would have rather spent $500 for three people somewhere else.\"",

I moved to Vegas about 1.5 years ago and was having trouble finding a stylist who understood what I was looking for and was consistently leaving salons unsatisfied with my cut (even brought me to tears once!). So...I found the salon that Jenna used to work at (which I won't name!) and looked at their website and decided I would pick the stylist who's personal style was closest to mine...and thus I found Jenna. When I went in for my appointment she gave me EXACTLY what I asked for PLUS I got bangs for the first time as an adult! She gave me her card before I left and advised me that bang trims were free. So  about 3 weeks later I was ready for a trim and called the salon. I was told that Jenna had left THREE WEEKS ago and they wouldn't tell me where she went. I was DESTROYED (I mean  not really  but I was really unhappy). Then I flipped over the card and realized she wrote her cell on the back...SCORE! Turns out Jenna actually left the salon the day after I had my appointment!  It was FATE (or something..)\\n\\nSo anywho  ever since then (it's been probably close to a year now  I think?) I've been going to Jenna at Tony Moreno for Cut  Color  & Brows. We've changed up my style a few times. Every single time she gives me EXACTLY what I've asked her for. I've NEVER had a stylist who could do that for me in the past. \\n\\nThe salon is super clean  really cute  and I can't imagine even thinking about trying out a different salon. Not only is she a great stylist  but she gives RIDICULOUS scalp massages  and it's always fun to chat with her. \\n\\nOnce I stopped by for a bang trim  and Jenna wasn't in so Tony shaped me up. Turned out perfect! I've never had a full cut done by him  but every client I've seen him do has been amazing as well! \\n\\nCheck out Tony Moreno Salon - you won't be disappointed  I guarantee it!",

That right there is a major issue.\\n\\nThe service is shotty  the waiters and what I believe to be a busboy or assistant waiter happen to know nothing about the menu.  Couldn't really answer questions and they actually contradicted each other.  I asked the waitress about the item that was on the menu that they no longer served and she said they didn't serve it anymore  two seconds later another guy claims that they do serve this item.  I'm going need the staff to know the menu and actually discuss what is going on inside the kitchen and with the menu.\\n\\nThe food was blah  I had the meatloaf and the mashed potatoes  the mashed potatoes were way too salty. It was unbearably salty and borderline uneatable.  The meatloaf was okay  nothing special at all about it but at least it tasted like what it was suppose to be and not just salt.\\n\\nPrices are a bit outrageous for the quality of service and food that you receive.  I have no plans on making a return trip to Central upon my next visit to Vegas.  Definitely not up to Michel Richard's standards.",

Carol W and I were well versed in Michel Richard's cuisine having dined at his Citronelle and Central in Washington D.C. and had previously dined for breakfast at Central Michel Richard and had walked away pleased.  This time...not so much. \\n\\nWe were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large round table in the sunny  airy dining room just off the Caesars' main lobby.  From this point on  our experience spiraled into the ground almost solely due to a series of missteps by our server.   Carol W recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond water in her review.  Let me add that we got up from the table  went to the bar  and asked the bartender if she could make any cocktails regardless if they were on the list or not.  She could.  So  service strike #1.  I can say with 100% certainty that our server lost beer and alcohol sales to our party.  Since we had early evening dinner reservations for later that day  several people in our party asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.  Our server didn't impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimates on portion size were dramatically off.  Service strike #2.  \\n\\nI had the plain Goat Cheese Caesar ($18 for Total Rewards members/$19/add chicken $6  filet mignon $13).  It was a nice looking salad  not over-dressed or overly salty  and possessing good flavor.  However  IT WAS A SALAD without a protein on it and $18 was exorbitant for what I received.  While there wasn't a third service strike  the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return.",

I was prepared to spend several hundred dollars on my corporate credit card to give my staff a nice pre-Halloween lunch.  I love this place and I love showing it off to new people.\\n\\nWell  the phone rang and rang and rang and finally went to a voicemail that was full so I couldn't leave a message.  (WTF?  Nobody is answering the phone or checking the voicemails?)\\n\\nSo I got on their website and sent an email to the restaurant's 'contact us' email address asking if someone could please call me so I could make a reservation.  A few minutes later I got an email from an employee named Kristy Smith in Marketing who said that they were booked solid for parties for the WHOLE ENTIRE MONTH of October.  \\n\\nCall me a bit of skeptic  but how can a restaurant that is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays be booked solid for five days a week from 11 AM to close for the ENTIRE month of October?  I can definitely imagine that they're busy as all get out right now  but booked completely solid for a whole month?  Really?  \\n\\nTo be fair she did say we could try to come and just squeeze in wherever we could be seated  but I'm of the mind that if you can find a way to fit 25 extra people in here or there  you can *probably* also find a way to push those tables and seats together into a group with little effort.  Being the person paying the check  it makes sense to want your group together  not shotgun blasted across the restaurant.  Otherwise it's just a confusing mess with a potentialy messed up check  and there is no group interaction...\\n\\nSo I replied and asked her if she meant booked solid for lunches  or dinners  or both?  And she replied that they were booked solid for BOTH.    O_o  \\n\\nWow  seriously???  That's GREAT news for you guys!!!  \\n\\nMaybe seeing as how popular Monsterland is becoming (thanks in all part to Yelpers like me who extol the virtues of this restaurant to almost anyone who'll listen) you guys should (at least though the whole month of October) open an hour early  or maybe even consider being open 7 days a week this month  so you can accommodate all the extra business that wants to give you several hundred dollars at a time?  This is THE month that people are most likely looking for spooky dining  so I would think this is the best time to maximize your profit potential  no?\\n\\nI was really  really looking forward to treating my staff to a fun  Halloween lunch and I foolishly even told them I would try to set it up this month before Halloween...  Now I feel like a weenie because I already got their hopes up and now I have to tell them that it isn't gonna happen after all.  Wonderful...\\n\\n\\nMonsterland  I really  TRULY am thrilled that you guys are getting more and more popular  but it sucks (like a starving vampire) that a huge fan like myself can't bring you 25 potential new fans AND spend a big old wad of money in your establishment this month.  :(",

Street parking available but pay attention to the signs.\\n\\nThe place: It's small  decor is minimal  and there's a pool table that in't very strategically positioned in the middle of the place. I'm still trying to figure that one out since if you happen to be sat right behind said pool table  you risk having your back or arse poked with a stick. Anyway. The theme here  is 80s-90s  which I can tolerate in small doses but not so much for an entire evening. The wait staff (at least the gals) are outfitted in retro 80s gear and the music being played is genre  Londonbeat  Madonna  Micheal Jackson etc. \\n\\nThe food: I went for Burger week. Will I go back? Nope. I orderd the veggie burger  also known as the Humus burger; while the bun itself was actually quite good  the patty was just this brown lump that  at first glance  didn't look very appetizing. Was it good? It was OK but I've had better Falafel-style patties elsewhere. Half my burger was missing the bottom so I basically ate that half with a knife and fork while I ate the other as a burger should be eaten: with my bare hands. The burger was topped with lettuce  tomato  exactly two sweet potato chips  and was accompanied by coleslaw. No fries included. As far as burgers go  it was dull. The coleslaw was spicy and just not good. Spicy coleslaw just doesn't work for me. My date ordered a meat burger that she said was burnt  and the accompanying fries were cold. \\n\\nService: The service was fine  but the waitress didn't explain the two different burgers that were on offer for Burger week (we told her that's why we were there). It was also incredibly slow to actually get our food - maybe that's why the fries were cold. On the up side  we weren't pressed to leave when were done. \\n\\nPrice point: $11 for the veggie burger. Personally  if you're going to give me a mediocre burger and not include fries  $11 is overpriced.",

We saw the sign out front advertising a pumpkin patch... so naturally  we had to stop. \\n\\nThe Farm is not really so much a farm  but more just a house with the yard converted into a veggie stand and something reminiscent of a farm. The backyard (which guests can see  but not go in) has goats  a giant pig  and chickens. Chickens and barn cats walk around freely with the guests  and there are cages throughout housing rabbits and baby birds. \\n\\nI was beyond excited when we came in last October. Growing up in Pittsburgh  I loved the fall and everything that came with it. This place had pumpkins and squash galore and dried corn stalks like we used to put out for Halloween when I was little!  Who knew something as silly as a corn stalk would make me so happy? We ended up spending a ton of time here looking at the animals and picking out the perfect pumpkin to carve. \\n\\nWe came back a few more times last fall  and just recently again this weekend while stopping at Gilcrease. Right now they have the best tomatoes and some summer squashes. I'm guessing in the next couple weeks they'll start to get their fall squashes (they carry dozens of varieties  some I had never heard of until I stopped last year). Did I mention that there's baby chickens running around right now? Well  there are. \\n\\nBesides produce  they also sell local honey  homemade jellies and pickles  and eggs straight from the chickens running around at your feet. I just bought some eggs yesterday but have yet to try one. I believe they have farm land in Utah  which is where they get their produce. I'm not 100% positive though  so don't take my word on it. \\n\\nYou should definitely make a stop here sometime and check this place out. Don't get too excited...again  it's just a house and a yard so don't be expecting tons of produce or a giant red barn with cows and horses. It's a sweet little place with very kind owners. \\n\\nWith all the animals  kids eat this place up....make sure you bring them!",

I called back on the 21st (still no part) and received a busy signal  then called back and no one answered the phone. I called later and talked to an employee that wasn't clear on where their employee (that deals with online orders) might be... maybe at another store and had no clue why I called and offered no help. I hung up the phone and send an email requesting a refund.\\n  My big Beef is that not only that I'm a customer but a owner of an arcade that not only  offers a fun place to be but also repairs consoles for customers (usually within 10 days depending on instock parts). For me to tell a paying customer \\\"\"\"\"Sorry but it's been 21 days and I still can't get in the part in\\\"\"\"\" is inexcusable. As for Gamer's Paradise I don't understand why they didn't catch their mistake before I called 16 days later wondering what happened to my order. It's not like it's a big business with thousands of employees. You think after a couple of days while checking their paypal account they would notice a discrepancy in their account of +$$$ in their paypal account and wonder why? Not only that no one knew what was going on with my order (oh thats _____ department)  all that really needed to be said was \\\"\"\"\"Sorry  we f*cked up! We're sending out that part ASAP / give you a refund\\\"\"\"\".\\n  Bottom line  I will not be placing an order with this company ever again and advise others to do the same.\"",

I should start from the beginning...........\\n\\nI had been looking forward to come here  so by the time our reservations rolled around I was ready to eat!!!!  We arrive about 15 min before our reservation  and proceeded to the bar to order a drink. \\n\\nFirst the access to the bartender was impossible and when we finally ordered my boyfriend had his drink in a few minutes and my glass of champagne no where to be seen ( we will revisit this later)  We waited for 10 min before the rest of our party showed and we were seated.  \\n\\nNOTE - they do have good music  and you can sit at the grand piano and have apps and cocktails.  The live music is a great cover.\\n\\nUpon sitting we promptly notified our waiter that we had not paid for our drinks at the bar and that I had ordered a glass and never received it.  He then took our drink order and returned with the beverages and I finally received my glass.  About 5 mins after that the server comes back with the first glass I ordered sitting down a 20 min old champagne that was flat and room temperature at that point - and proceed to charge me for it!!!!!  He appeared to think this was an accomplishment that he found the glass  I was at this point just annoyed and thought it was poor taste.\\n\\nThe Food:  Such promise to fall so flat  the menu does offer a variety other than steak  but a larger seafood selection and some chefs specials.  \\n\\nApps - we ordered the Calamari and the Burrata with Roast Peppers ( why they give 1 piece of crostini for 4 people I don't understand)  I had to ask for extra 2X and then is dropped about 7 pieces on the plate ( OVERKILL)\\n\\nThe calamari was decent but nothing to rave about  the breading is lighter and there are two dipping sauces  and remulaude and cocktail.\\n\\nI ordered the Bone in Filet Medium  this is were I just get upset.  It comes out half well done and the other half raw!!!!!!!!!!!! I am not even sure how one can achieve cooking a steak that bad but it was the worse I have ever had  EVER.  \\n\\nSides - FAMILY STYLE  so if you order  1 side will split 4 ways easy  the server said that it would serve 4 tops  but I think it could push serving 6 people.

He now has a new stop...bringing meals to the South Park crowd by setting up at Pfeiffer University off of Park Road in the back parking lot on Thursday nights. You can also find him at Innovation Park and near Johnson & Wales University. \\n\\nHis menu consists of regular burgers  black bean burgers (for the veggie lovers)  and shawarmas (just to name a few) and then depending on the week he'll offer different specials. His fries are too tempting and generously seasoned. The prices are very reasonable (starting at $6) and already includes tax...you cannot get a better deal! While cash is preferred  he does accept credit cards. \\n\\nWhen you see this giant blue truck  you'll definitely want to stop and get a meal. You'll receive friendly service as well!\"",

Just... wow.\\n\\nLocated in an old 19th century farm house in semi-rural Conestoga  Rumbletum might be the nicest looking  coziest cafe / gift shop I've ever set foot in anywhere on the planet.  I went there for a boardgame event with 25 other geeks... most of these geeks are used to playing games in less-than-beautiful surroundings  and really don't care about a venue's appearance.  Still  many of them were simply blown away by Rumbletum.\\n\\nThe owners  Quinn and Heidi  are friendly and personable  the sort that want to see you happy.  This is a refreshing change from the jaded  stand-offish service I'm becoming accustomed to in many Toronto shops.  \\n\\nIt is mostly Heidi's shop -- Quinn contributes boardgame goodness at deeply discounted prices -- and her background as a graphic artist really shines through  from the meticulously scripted chalkboard menus to the quaint and quirky bathroom product display... in an actual bathroom.\\n\\nIt's difficult for me to really classify Rumbletum in terms of its gift offerings  but home decor and art really seem to be the focus  with all manner of eclectic giftware to be found in nooks and crannies throughout the house.  This really is a shopping experience  where you can completely lose track of both time and purpose as you poke about and marvel at all the little goodies there are to find.\\n\\nAs for the cafe side of things  damned if they don't make an assortment of ridiculously tasty grilled sandwiches (the veggie is divine!  $7ish as I recall)  some killer chocolate chip cookies (85cents!)  and a rather nice cup of java (with lots of choices that range from about $2-$4).  \\n\\nI didn't sample their other baked goods  but they looked rather epic -- the cakes in particular were begging to make me fat again.  Finally  they offer up loose leaf teas  a seasonal soup  milk shakes  smoothies  and ice cream to round out a focused  comforting menu that ties nicely to the space itself.  It's kind of like eating in your slightly oddball aunt's old house -- if your aunt was a graphic artist wanting to sell you amusingly offensive silk-screened toilet paper.\\n\\nIn any case  I'll sum up Rumbletum thusly:\\n\\n1)  Gorgeous.\\n2)  Tasty sandwiches and a good cup of joe.\\n3)  Easy to spend two hours poking about a really cool boutique.\\n4)  Local flavour and cool people.\\n5)  Boardgames for sale.  Criminally cheap.\\n\\n5 stars.  I was blown away.",

We tried the double guac app which came with a little pork belly. The pork belly was great but one of the guacs was swapped in over salty queso cheese and honestly it was borderline gross. Way too much salt packed into a little punch not enough fresh garlic or lime or cilantro flavors in their guac. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas they were new American style meaning not baked they used corn tortillas (not a great choice if you love soft enchiladas. Their was some odd white sauce with the chicken which was nicely cooked  very tender. The rice was overly bland and beans were just ok. In short I doused the thing in Cholula and longed for my own mole pulled pork enchiladas. \\n\\nThe drinks: we had mojitos the first ones were good the second had way too much lime juice. I guess as the night wore on less care was taken. I could say the same for our waiter he was very attentive until after our appetizer came then we barely saw him. \\n\\nThe positives its a very nice space to eat in  we were able to be seated on a feb sat night within a half hour.

That said  we often find the bar area to be difficult for conversation  so we asked for tables to be pushed together along the back wall  and we asked for separate checks.  What we loved:  hand mixed margaritas (we love the bartenders here) and Negra Modela on draft (why every Mexican restaurant doesn't do this is beyond me).  What we had issues with:  Service  service  service.  We were told separate checks were OK until we got one check and had to split drinks and apps and food orders out ourselves and figure out bill on the back of the check.  Of course  the server could add his 20% on as we were then a large group.  Ah  but his service was not worth 20 %.  I ordered a draft  my friend ordered one bottled beer  and we got two bottled beers (which were a little off in flavor)  and he waved me off when I tried to get his attention to remind him that I never got my draft.

The black beans are canned and rinsed and have little seasoning.  They put \\\"\"\"\"simple syrup\\\"\"\"\" in their chipotle salsa along with agave syrup.  I asked because I could tell.  \\\"\"\"\"Simple syrup\\\"\"\"\" is just sugar and water.  The sugars completely dominate the flavor of the salsa  and of course we were told \\\"\"\"\"everyone loves it.\\\"\"\"\"  Nope.  Not everyone!   In Tucson or Austin that would be thrown against the wall.  The pork and pulled chicken are definitely slow-cooked and tender which is good  but not seasoned well at all.   Also  they do not fold the burritos correctly so you end up with ends that are almost entirely flour tortilla with no filling.  The tortillas are clearly not made fresh or on-site and have dough conditioners in them like you would buy mass-marketed at a supermarket.  I'm guessing that the diced tomato they use for their pico de gallo comes from a bag pre-diced by their food supplier.  The texture indicates this.  The chips were okay.  They were deep fried corn tortillas but that's nothing new.  You also have to pay for them which does not happen in places where Mexican food is a restaurant staple.  \\n\\nNo one in Pittsburgh is doing Mexican food right  but I keep looking.  \\n\\nOverall  Verde has a nice looking space  and the service is okay (at least the day we went)  but the food is comical considering it calls itself \\\"\"\"\"Mexican.\\\"\"\"\"  It is not representative and this place would do well to send its cooking staff on a trip through Mexico.\"",

I was glad that I had made a reservation in advance because it was awesome going right to our table for 10 girls without a wait of any hassle! the staff was extremely helpful (and we all agreed they were super cute). The weather was nice outside and although it got colder as the night crept in  they had a huge fire pit and gas powered heaters scattered throughout. The live music was wonderful and the musician was funny and took requests. He even allowed our friend Ricki to perform her original song! It was awesome! We ate a bunch of appetizers like salmon bruschetta  chicken wings  escargot  and spinach dip I think it was. The flatbreads were great too! They have a great selection of wine  we stayed for hours getting tipsy in a classy manner  it was after all my sister's last night as a single lady!",

On Saturday  I took my two years old to that place since he is having fever for a couple of days and we could not bring the fever down with Tylenol. The doctor there could not see what inside my son's ears clearly and my son did not want to open his month either for the doctor to see his throat. The doctor then said \\\"\"\"\"let just give him some antibiotics for precaution\\\"\"\"\".  I told the doctor that we will leave Las Vegas for home the second day.  I told him there are CVS and walgreen near the hotel we stay. I took the prescription to both CVS and walgreen and none of them carry this antibiotics! The lady in walgreen said they have to order this if I really want it. It seems the doctor has no idea what the pharmacy normally carry. This is not the worst part yet.\\n\\nI called the doctor and asked for a replacement antibiotics. The nurse said they can not fax the new prescription to me. it is their policy not to do this. I have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them. I did not rent a car so I decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.\\n\\nThe lady in walgreen called the doctor. it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phone. she said the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more. Anyway  the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin. My son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time. The lady in the walgreen said she only has four bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg. I was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take. So  I questioned the doctor over the phone. I had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse. The nurse said the doctor said it is correct! I still had doubt since even my insurance said the maximum is .75 something(?) and special manual override is needed if more is prescribed by the doctor.  Then the doctor said he wants to talk to the pharmacist. I gave my phone to the pharmacist. I guess the doctor yelled at her again. The pharmacist asked me why I was trying to give her a hard time? I was surprised by her question. All I want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and don't want to overdose my son. In the end  I said I only need two days' worth and I will get the rest when I get back home. For whatever reason  she gave me two bottles which is four days' worth. (about 45mg total). \\n\\nA couple of days after I got back home  I took my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also I was wondering if I need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen. fortunately  I did take him to his pediatrics. The pediatrics said the concentra doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again. for this type of antibiotics and for my son's age  he only need to take one teaspoon (5ml) a day for five days (total 25ml). Since my son has been taking the antibiotics for almost three days (30ml)  we should stop give him more antibiotics. He had enough already. This antibiotics he took will stay and last for another several days. \\n\\nThe doctor in concentra asked my son to take  4~5 times more antibiotics than he should. It is insane. Also  his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad. I hope there is something I can do to stop him from hurting other people. To leave a proper review here  I think  is the least I can do for now.\"",

We were seated outside after a 10 minute wait or so  which is typical at popping restaurant during lunchtime.  But things soon went downhill from there . . . \\n\\nAfter taking our orders  my yellow curry took approximately 35-40 minutes to come out.  I had to ask for utensils twice once my food came out.  At the 45-50 minute point  my co-worker and I decided that we couldn't stay to eat and would need to take our food to go.  So we asked that her food (which hadn't come out yet) be placed in a container and asked for a container for my food.                \\n\\nThe waiter brought me a small  wire handle take out box.

There's no way that my big bowl of curry fit into that small container  which means I paid for food that I did not eat or take with me.\\n\\nBy this point  we were really hungry and so ready to go.  I gave the waiter my card to pay  only to have him come back and say that their machine was down.  We waited approximately another 10 minutes  before he came back and said the machine was indefinitely down.  He then suggested we go to an ATM down the street and take out cash  or that we could speak with the manager to make \\\"\"\"\"arrangements.\\\"\"\"\"  WHAT?!?!?!?!\\n\\nI'm not sure if the other waiter was out sick that day or what happened.  But we spent almost an hour and a half waiting for our food and/or trying to pay and leave.  We didn't get to eat until we got back to work.

Nice and strong!\\n\\nI ordered Pad See Ewe and my girlfriend had Pad Thai. Normally Thai places never make anything spicy enough for me. They usually ask for for 1-3 stars or whatever and I always say 4 and its still not that hot. For some reason I had a different feeling about this place and chose a 4 out of 5. It was just perfect for me  hot enough to make my nose run but not too hot to eat. And it was omfg awesome delicious to the point of ruining Thai food for me basically anywhere else. I seriously cant believe how awesome this dish was. \\n\\nMy girlfriends Pad Thai was equally awesome  she said it was the best she has ever had. She got a level 2 for spice and I found it fairly mild but she likes to add sriracha and it was perfect for her. Everything was cooked just right and tasted extremely fresh. I took a couple of bites and agreed.\\n\\nHalfway through eating (unfortunately) our waiter brought us a small asortment of condiments. House-pickled jalapenos  house-made thai garlic chili sauce  some dried hot peppers and a bottle of sriracha. The jalapenos and garlic chili sauce were awesome.

Instead of going to First Friday  my friend and I decided to beat the crowd and head to Fremont Street a little early and get some drinks.  To my pleasant surprise  Le Thai was not very busy at all.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is quite small with about 4-5 tables inside and a bar seating area that seats about 8 as well as the actual bar that seats about 8.  It also has a back patio that has tables  as well as a front patio section.  It's cute inside  but it was warm.  Granted  it was about 110 outside  the AC was probably having a hard time keeping up.\\n\\nAnyway  our server was nice but not very attentive.  We placed our food order and told him we'd order drinks in a second since we never got a drink menu and had to ask him for it.  He never came back to get our drink order so we asked the SA who dropped off our food and he had to go find him for us.  Also  they dropped off food but never gave us untensils  so we also asked the server when he came to get our drink order.\\n\\nWe ordered the waterfall beef  which comes with a side of sticky rice.  Holy YUMMO!  This dish is out of this world.  I could just eat this all day long.  It totally reminds me of food my mom used to make for us growing up.  SO EFFIN BOMB.  It's basically sauteed beef drenched in this lime/fish sauce.  The sauce wasn't very potent so those opposed to fish sauce might still even like it.  I  however  LOVED it and was drenching my sticky rice with it.  \\n\\nWe also ordered some Pad Thai to share. On a scale of 1-5 spicy level  I ordered a 2 and it was dang spicy!  Even my friend  who loves spicy  agreed that it was quite spicy.  Despite that  it was freakin' delicious.  It's some of the best pad thai I've ever had.  \\n\\nThe food here is off the chain.

Since Wednesday is not Fry-day  except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free  I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.\\n\\nSo  I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place  but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.\\n\\nFirst off  this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place  so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because  how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.\\n\\nThe egg roll was among  if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.\\n\\nThen came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was  it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.\\n\\nSeriously  if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian  skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay versus getting food at Asian 1.",

They said that wasn't enough so I ordered generals chicken as well. The order was placed at 7:20 arrived at 8:30 with no Habachi Steak. The manager said we didn't charge you for the steak but if you want it I can charge your credit card another $13 and deliver it to you. I said come and pick up the food you delivered and bring me the Habachi steak and just charge me $15. She said we can't do that  no we have to charge you again.   So instead of paying $20 for a meal they're requesting I pay $33 total.  That was the last time I'll ever order from them again. They're several other Asian restaurants in the area with better service and better food. This was that time when i knew exactly what i wanted to eat and didn't get it.",

The \\\"\"\"\"waitnurses \\\"\"\"\" as I'd like to coin this term  are very friendly  save the one I accidentally caught scratching the middle pocket of her apron around the area near what some would call \\\"\"\"\"wonderland.\\\"\"\"\" Oh  of course she happened to be the one to serve us. \\n\\nMy brother  my love and I went in  were draped in their clean bib-acting robes. As we passed by a wheelchair for an obese person  I wondered to myself if anybody actually sat in that chair before and fit the chair. I was expecting a fun evening  especially for my brother  who just turned 21 and was in town for New Year's weekend. \\n\\nPreviously  I had stopped by once before to get their chocolate shake. The hostess ordered it for me  and curiosity got the best of me  so I had to ask how many calories the chocolate shake was. I was thinking maybe 1000 would be a little bit close to my expectation of unhealthy  but it was double that amount! 2000 whopping calories for what Ryan H. described as an East Coast frozen custard - I took it to go and shared it with my love and together we were both able to have half of it. We couldn't do the rest. They advertise that it's pure creme. I don't mind killing myself for good food  but I would say this was a tad bit better than mediocre. \\n\\nTo the dinner... we had the\\n\\nTriple Bypass: our waitnurse (the one who scratched her area) wouldn't let us split at first  and we told her that we had already eaten and were just passing by and wanted to try them  so she allowed us to split it ourselves. Grilled onions must have been on the sideline of the grill for a while  because they sure were out of practice and didn't do their part. They were lukewarm and had no flavor  not even anything savory. The bacon somewhat tried to attack us  but they needed more of a defense because again they were benching players. Bacon strips were also lukewarm. The meat was not a seasoned player  didn't know how to attack us and the sliced tomatoes were not signed on this season  so they were a no-go either. The only thing that attacked us horribly were the calories. The Quadruple Bypass is 8000 calories according to our waitnurse  and we had the Triple  so minus maybe 1500 calories brings us to about 6500 calories split between the three of us. Well  I didn't do bread  so it's a little more for the guys. \\n\\nWe also ordered 3 Cokes and the\\n\\nVanilla Shake: this was yummier than the chocolate shake  but it definitely did taste like butter  but not like a butter popcorn jelly belly as someone else mentioned in their review. I would like to add that for the amount of calories it had  it should taste great  but it wasn't really up to par with its 2000 average daily value calories. My brother really enjoyed the shake. I enjoyed it also  but perhaps because the burger was so disappointing. Le sigh...\\n\\nAs we were waiting for our fries to get to us  we saw a doctor-costumed bartender dancing with a waitnurse who was kind of DJing and counting the minutes to New Year's. They were having fun dancing  and yes  there were dim TVs if you were sitting right next to them  but if you were far enough away  you were able to see music videos from the 80's paired next to videos of a doctor using his stethoscope to pat the burger meat down onto the grill. \\n\\nLard-fried Fries: I had a total of about three fries from the basket of fries. No  I'm not obsessively counting calories and at this point it wouldn't even matter. However  I was very disappointed that the texture of the fries weren't identifiable. I could say what it wasn't. It wasn't crispy. It wasn't freshly soggy like In N' Out. It wasn't delicious or had a certain taste to it. It was the most apathetic basket of fries I had ever met. \\\"\"\"\"Hello  Fries. Okay. I see. Goodbye. You don't care? Okay.\\\"\"\"\" \\n\\nOur waitnurse brought us the bill. Throughout the entire dinner  we figured out where she had her hand on our plates and the bill  so we weren't nervous about her being our waitress  not at all. I'd like to add to her benefit of the doubt  that all the waitnurses are made to wear red bras and undershorts that are possibly uncomfortable. \\n\\nI asked my brother if he had fun. He enjoyed the experience  but he didn't like the food. I am a good food hunter. I feel I disappointed my brother and should have listened to the few and the wise on Yelp  but wanted to try it for myself  hoping to regain a few stars of hope for this new and grotesquely interesting place. Hope? Nope. I wish the Denny's had opened there instead. Sorry  Dr. Jon. Nutritionist gone wild? Well  this is \\u00a1\\u00a1\\u00a1\\u00a1Mad Food Yelper gone fariggin' LOCA!!!! Okay.

If you don't finish your food  your waitress will ask you to move to the center of the restaurant for a spanking in front of everyone with a wooden paddle.  Of course  you can decline.  The waitress prepared to paddle my wife and I yelled \\\"\"\"\"spank her hard!\\\"\"\"\"  She was spanked normally just like everyone else.  When it was my turn  the waitress insisted on spanking me 3 times.  I'm certain that our waitress played softball or tennis because she damn near broke the paddle on my butt. \\n\\nThe manager (I think her name is Tracy) was so nice to us  and chatted with us during our entire meal.  We had a terrific time and we'll certainly go back next time we are in Vegas.\\n\\nBy the way  this is Vegas.  If you are in Vegas  I hope you have a sense of humor.  It's a town where trucks with billboards drive up and down the strip offering \\\"\"\"\"girls to your room tonight \\\"\"\"\" the casinos are filled with smoke  and people hemorrhage their life savings every day.  Heart Attack Grill is a nice break from all of that.  It's just basic American greasy food served by sexy nurses who spank you with a wooden paddle if you don't finish your meal.  So  go to the Heart Attack Grill- and ask for Tracie.  Tell her that you want one of her special pina colada jello shots.  Trust me  you'll laugh until you cry.  Get a burger  try to finish it... or don't try  if you're into that.\"",

Going to Vegas and having our Sunday night free we decided to go to the Freakling Brothers Trilogy Of Terror for some Halloween fun. \\n\\nFrom the outside all 3 look like some sort of carnival setup or something that you see victims go into and never come out of. I never imagined that the houses were made with trailers hooked up because for me it is as real and as good as some of the best haunts I've been to.  All 3 were really well done. I don't want to give away any details. If you go be sure to buy the VIP front of the line pass. Plus you get a tshirt all of an extra $10 not bad.\\n\\nWe started out with Circus of Terror. Let me say that even the ticket takers are dressed up and before you go in a ringmaster asks us if we want to go inside and gives us the rules. Once we set foot inside I was amazed that each one was so detailed so dark and twisted in it's own way. I don't want to give away anything. There are rooms where something happens and rooms where \\\"\"\"\"you have to figure out what to do\\\"\"\"\". Let's say the ending is something I won't ever forget.\\n\\nWe then went into Castle Vampyre. Igor took our tickets and the vampire lady told us the rules and made sure we wanted to go inside. Again it is dark and twisted. This was my favorite out of all 3 of them. There were rooms we had to figure out what to do and some effects that made me stop for a moment because I really thought I had to use \\\"\"\"\"the rope\\\"\"\"\" to go across. The ending had me standing there in awe just watching more than being scared. \\n\\nThe final house we went thru was the Gates of Hell. This one you have to sign a waiver because it is R rated and no one under 17 are admitted. I admit I was pretty freaked out because I found out about one of the things they do but I was fine inside. This one you have a \\\"\"\"\"safe word\\\"\"\"\" similar to Knott's Trapped. But unlike Trapped this is very and I mean VERY intense. YOU are definitely touched  shoved  called names  there is profanity. We ran into a group 2 girls in front of us because they couldn't find their way. Definitely had to use my hands to navigate thru several times it was that dark. The ending really well done. \\n\\nI can't imagine \\\"\"\"\"The Victim Experience\\\"\"\"\". Just the normal one was intense enough for me. I wanted to say the safe word but managed to get thru the entire experience. One that I won't ever forget.\\n\\nThe pictures they take when you first arrive are top quality and the price isn't bad. We bought 4 of them as a keepsake. Now nothing I do for Halloween will compare to being traumatized by the Freakling Brothers Trilogy Of Terror. Hopefully I will be back in the future.\\n\\nIf you haven't gone and live nearby it's definitely worth it.\"",

I live in Los Angeles  so there's no shortage of haunts in October  but so many of them are pretty big and hire people that say \\\"\"\"\"boo\\\"\"\"\" and want a paycheck rather than hiring people who love it and get it. Freakling only allows a few people in at a time  so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in a conga line and seeing a scare too early. They also treat everyone equal. I'm a tattooed male and in most haunted houses  I get left alone so they can focus on the screaming girl within the group. Freakling doesn't care at all about who you are or if they think they can/can't scare you...they just go for it and it's amazing!\\n\\nMost people have covered the separate houses in other reviews. I loved them. So many cool effects and illusions that make you go ...WHOA! I was so impressed with all of them.\\n\\nNow...The Victim Experience. I wanted to try this last year  but couldn't make a trip to Vegas work. I signed up as soon as tickets went on sale for this year. I did it and survived. I can't talk about what happened inside  but I will say that it was one of the most brutal (mentally and physically) experiences I've ever had. After surviving  I felt like I could take on the world. It was such an accomplishment. If you decide that you want to take on the next level of extreme haunt....I wish you the best! If you survive  you will feel amazing and be part of the Freakling family instantly :)\"",

Do not use these people..if my warranty company agreed to reimburse me which by contract they have no obligation to do so since I did not go through their dispute department but acknowledged after talking to the company that fixed the problem that the Athena employee was either inept  incompetent  or just lazy proves or at least supports my impression of Athena's unprofessional and incompetence.",

The waitress took it back to get us the one without coconut  but came back saying that the kitchen does not know the difference between the ones with coconut and without.

At Madras  the food is all Indian all the time  and that is what is going to keep me coming back!  A great tip is that at the end of your meal when you are walking out  they have a bowl called Mukhwas  or basically \\\"\"\"\"mouth freshener.\\\"\"\"\"  The mix is cardamom  anise seed  and coconut candy  and one half spoon full in your hand that you put into your mouth really helps to sooth your stomach after the meal.

We actually ate a few more meals out of the left overs...and the waiter was very gracious about not teasing us.  I think he was awesome!\\n\\nService was fast and great!  I think I would go back and just get onion pakora and an order of Sambar Vadai and call it way more than enough!  If you are ready to try something new I suggest giving them a try!",

Stop.  \\n\\nI know that the 16 dollar burger joints are all the rage  but stop with the wine pairings and upscalifying of it.  If you're gonna charge that much for a burger and then $4.50 for an order of fries they better be badass.  My burger was overcooked and underseasoned  and underwhelming.  Not bad  but small and overly precious.\\n\\nI also hate when joints like this serve their food on a fancy plate to make it look fancy.  They have these fry server things with a sauce receptacle that makes an order of fries 18 inches tall and all fancy-looking.  Problem is there's only 20 fries and the fancy aioli sucked in spite of the special serving containter.  Fries with champagne and shallots?  No thanks.\\n\\nSo  the concept is wrong.  The value is not there.  The portion sizes are laughable.  The food is ok at best.  The room is schizophrenic.  Is it a bar  a restaurant  a soda fountain?

Yet we waited for over an hour for 2 orders of crepes  french toast  and a sandwich. Really? \\n\\nOur waitress was not much for conversation. My friend  who is notoriously more picky than my brother requested whipped cream instead of something else in her crepe.

She wanted to add whipped cream not lobster I don't see what the fuss was about to begin with- bygones.\\n\\nI ordered a fruit crepe.

If I thought my crepe saw a rough afternoon her looked like it was literally dropped on the floor a few times then thrown on the plate. Guess they showed her for ordering that whipped cream? I can see now why the waitress warned us not to change the menu. May I suggest that their employees partake in some local anger management meetings?\\n\\nMy brother ordered the savory french toast.

I paid $80 for the pen and choose to be loyal to them and buy other items like a dabbing rig as well.  The owner seemed chill when I bought the product and then when I came in to replace the product acted upset because he gets a lot of returns on that product specifically.   Here's a thought : if the product is cheap don't sell it.  And certainly don't get annoyed with your customers because of it.  If you choose a terrible product to sell and you know it's a cheap ineffective product and refuse to help me when I show you it's broke then I'm not going to spend another dime in your store.

        "text": "\"Goodness  how did we end up here? We were at this mall in Tempe attending a disappointing Road Runner Sports event and found ourselves starving and smelling something delicious in the air. We walked up and down the mall looking for someplace that could accommodate the newly vegan husband and somewhat picky kids. Sushi looked good but not for kids. California Pizza too many carbs. Mexican joint to busy and bar like. Cadillac Ranch no  been there before. Some Chinese place no beer  it is Friday night damn it. Smash Burger? Little one and vegan nixed that. Back to the Thirsty Lion - I think the thought of beer and no line settled it. Live and Learn. Live and Learn...\\n\\nSo we were seated right away  in the bar basically. Approached by our waitress  she was brusk but helpful. We order beer and soda (it's Friday people!) and the edamame appetizer. She brings the sodas. Another woman brings one beer. I mention we ordered two she looks surprised and says cheerfully \\\"\"\"\"It's on it's way!!\\\"\"\"\".  Um  no. I see our waitress passing by I mention we only received one beer. Okay. She goes and gets it. Edamame comes right away. YUM. It was spicy  garlicky  salty goodness. We should have stopped there but no  we pressed on. \\n\\nI order the steak salad  she asks: how do you like your steak cooked? I respond: medium rare. The little voice in my head says \\\"\"\"\" You should ask what cut of meat it is\\\"\"\"\" Shush Voice  I'm getting meat! I say in my head back. My husband orders the closest thing he can find to vegan food: a veggie panini but asks No CHEESE. She says okay and writes it down  I watched. Little one orders off the kid's menu: mac and cheese. Big boy orders Fish and Chips. \\n\\nWe are happily eating our edamame and watching the Tempe Mall groupies doing their thing. I decide to visit the ladies room and this is a huge place so I set out in the most logical direction. I run into our waitress and ask  Where's the ladies room? She was so sweet she actually walked me most of the way there! Great service! I was impressed. The restroom is just around the corner of the pizza making guys. I thought I should have ordered pizza. Yummy looking. \\n\\nI get back and the food is delivered. Where do I start? Steak Salad: meat was rare and tough. It should have been cooked more. The salad greens were fresh  red pepper good  onions too strong  dressing was nice and not too much. They put chimichurri sauce on the steak. It was over powered with thyme or marjoram. Too flowery and I've cooked with chimichurri and like it. But what was awful was the gristle. Made most of it inedible. \\n\\nLittle kid: his mac and cheese was fancy so of course he didn't like it. So I quickly ordered him french fries and then they were crazy salty so he didn't eat those either. Luckily (?) the waitress was generous with the soda. Big kid: very much enjoyed the fish and chips. I tried them - a bit fishy but the best thing on the table!\\n\\nNow let's go vegan shall we? So immediately my husband takes a bite - into cheese. And stops eating. He looks through his sandwich plenty of provolone and mozzarella. A few minutes later the waitress comes by and asks if he is done  he says yes because there is cheese on the sandwich  she says sorry and walks away with the sandwich. We look at each other and say how is this going to turn out? So my husband sits there with no food while we eat. He eats a couple of french fries  we finish and she comes back with the check. For the full bill of 76.51 including the panini. Really???? Really. \\n\\nShe comes to collect and we ask about the sandwich and she demands: What do you want?? What do you want? My husband says I would have liked to have eaten with my family. She says: Would you like another sandwich? He says everyone is done eating. She says I'll bring you one to go! He says okay. A few minutes later she brings the sandwich and the same check. Alrighty we get your point. We pay the bill and give her a tip of 15% based on the three meals and drinks that were appropriately delivered. \\n\\nNeedless to say we will never return. Never.... ever .....ever.\"",

Literally the worst massage my mom and I have ever had  to the point that it's become a joke in our family to say  \\\"\"\"\"Boy  I need a massage after that massage!\\\"\"\"\" after experiencing something far below expectations. \\n\\nNeither of our massage people seemed to have experience or training in giving a massage  so much so that we wonder if they had a license at all. We came in with sore feet after calling ahead for two foot massage appointments. We never wanted our back or any other part of our body massaged  just our feet as that's what our appointments were. This entire experience was a huge mistake. \\n\\nThey led us to a room near the front door - these are partitions  like cubicles  and Mom and I were in the same partition. There were overstuffed hospital beds and ottomans in the room  we sat down after being led there and waited a good 10 minutes. Had they forgotten about us? \\n\\nAfter waiting  our people (not deserving of the name masseuse  so I don't know what else to call them?) brought two tubs of warm water in and had us sit on the ottomans. I love to soak my feet in warm water when they're sore  so at this point I was still on board. But it started to get weird very quickly. \\n\\nWhile soaking our feet and sitting on the ottoman  our people started massaging our shoulders - isn't this a foot massage? Then they started forcing our backs downward by compressing our spine aggressively. This sucked  there's no other way to describe it. Our backs were unsupported as we were sitting and undergoing stress and pressure that these inexperienced people were applying. It was pretty horrible  but that's not even the worst part. \\n\\nNext they had us on the hospital bed  and massaged our feet. This part was actually somewhat agreeable  and both my mom and I were thinking the massage was headed in the right direction. Until they started slapping our feet and legs. Punching our feet and legs  then slapping again. This was so uncomfortable that any benefit gained from the foot massage had completely dissipated. \\n\\nNow we get crazy. They have us lay on our stomachs and start massaging our backs  my person - who's a guy by the way - decides he's going to take off my shirt. So while I'm still on my stomach he tugs and pulls until he yanks my shirt off. I'm wearing two shirts  so he repeats this. Feeling fully molested  all I can think is: This is supposed to be a foot massage!!! \\n\\nNext comes what is similar in pain to a Thai massage  with horrific technique. Punching and shoving my spine around  I kept telling him stop! You're hurting me! Be gentler! He's completely ignoring me so I repeatedly say OUCH! But he never got the hint  even with hand gestures asking him to stop. \\n\\nBy the time this ended  I'm shirtless and in so much pain. How could the reviews on Yelp! have been so off  how could it have led me so far astray?\\n\\nAs we dress as quickly as possible  leave a tip by the side of each of the beds  and hobble to our car as fast as we can to get away  my person runs into the parking lot after us  as we are trying to back out the car from its space. \\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"Tip-uh?\\\"\"\"\" He says  holding out his hands through the window I had rolled down. \\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"We left a tip by the beds in the room \\\"\"\"\" I said  completely in shock by how this asshole who actually hurt me and didn't deserve a penny of tip  could be so brazen to run after us in the parking lot. Not to mention how crude it is  and we had left generous tips. \\n\\nCompletely disgusted by the experience  we try to drive away once again  when the MANAGER runs out into the parking lot and knocks on the window as our car is MOVING. I roll down the window only a crack  worried about how this nightmare could get any worse. He tries to shove frequent visitors cards through the crack. \\\"\"\"\"No thank you  no thank you \\\"\"\"\" I say repeatedly. No matter  all he needed was to shove those cards in while we were still trying to leave. \\n\\nAll in all  I've never had an experience so opposed in quality and satisfaction to the rating the facility carries on Yelp! I can only hope that future patrols will read my review and Michelle's review and stay as far away from this place as possible.\"",

Drink in said mini-bus and make friends. Arrive at the first club. Skip the line  don't pay cover. Dance  drink for an hour or two  then at a particular time hosts will tell you it's time to go to the next place. Repeat for two more clubs. As the evening goes on  the different groups consolidate into fewer and fewer buses as people stay at clubs they like or just get tired and leave. By the final club  all the groups are back together again. At the end of the night  find your way home (or ride the bus to a strip club.)\\n\\nWhy it's good:\\n1) Skip the freaking idiotic lines at three pretty darn good clubs.\\n2) You get to hang out with the same group of people all evening long... and you're stuck on a freaking bus  drunk  so everyone is really social. (The two strangers who met on the bus next to me got REALLY social  if you know what I mean.)\\n3) The hosts are awesome. They drank with us  had a pole dancing dance off  and were just genuinely nice.\\n4) The bus was surprisingly clean and comfortable. It's nice to sit for a bit after dancing. And it felt like a party in there.\\n\\nWhy it's bad (and no  the bads are not that bad):\\n1) Casinos are huge so there's still a bit of walking from bus drop off to the clubs.\\n2) The free shots on the bus taste like cough medicine.\\n3) If two bachelor parties end up on the same bus  it's a freaking sausage fest (you can switch buses later  so it only matters in the beginning.)\\n4) There's a little down time when people are waiting to leave the club.

Everything is clean  hip and trendy. It's decently sized and I didn't feel cramped like you do at some spas/salons. \\n\\nThe pedicure was amazing! Wow! What took me so long. My feet felt incredible after and I want to go back. I would go into detail about what the pedicure consisted of but not only do I not totally remember  but I don't know the official lingo of everything. I will say there was some clipping  scrubbing  cleaning and painting (just a clear coat! Haha!). Oh  yeah  they also allow you to bring some booze and have some stocked for your pleasure as well. Awesome sangria! \\n\\nHuuuuge shout out to the fabulous ladies at the salon. They were friendly and totally easy going. We had great conversation and I felt at ease through the whole process.

Never had a problem with quality or value for price.  I personally love the pastrami burger and country omelette. The place reminds me of the counter service diners I've been to in downtown Chicago in many ways (anyone reading this old enough to remember the \\\"\"\"\"cheeseburger\\\"\"\"\"sketch on SNL??).\\n\\nHOWEVER- Service is something that could improve. They seem to go through staff like paper towels. I think that may be part of the issue and its a sign of a core issue in management/ownership. Ordering at counter is usually not a bad experience  but I have to agree  that Jim's wife is not a warm and fuzzy person.  I have been working in service for the last 30 years and I wouldn't have lasted that long if I I wasn't welcoming and accommodating to my  guests.  I don't frequent another area diner at Greenway and Reems for that very reason- poor customer service. \\n\\n Yesterday was my worst experience there ever.  It was very busy  which you would expect for 10AM Saturday.  My 7 year old son really wanted to have breakfast there  so despite the crowd  we ordered.  Every table was full and most were waiting for orders..  I figured it would be a wait  but maybe only 10 minutes longer than usual.  I was mistaken  It took  almost 1 hour from the time we ordered until our food came.  This was breakfast.  Quick and easy to prepare. 1 Hour????  When our food did arrive  nothing was wrong with it  but our server  was obviously pushed to her limits (only 2 servers working that morning).  She forgot syrup for my sons pancake and I had to get up and get.  No one behind the counter even apologized   even though I was obviously put off I had to get my own condiments.  The water I ordered from her never came either.  Very poor service to say the least.\\n\\nI understand  bad days happen at every job  but maybe they could have been proactive at the counter and let people know how long the wait time for food was going to be?  Since you pay in advance here  its difficult to get a refund.  And then last night on Facebook  instead of posting an apology to their loyal (an inconvenienced) customers  they posted marketing pictures of their food.  Really??  Maybe an apology with an offer to bring in your breakfast receipt for a discount on a return visit would have been a better idea?\\n\\nWe will return  but you're on final notice with us Jim's.  We want to patronize local businesses  but food alone doesn't cut it in this business.  You need to provide friendly  expedited service too!\"",

The building looks very new and the interior is smaller  but modern and clean. When I arrived late afternoon on a Thursday there were only couple of other patrons there. The female bartender was very friendly and accommodating. She told me about their $2 Dos Equis special. I usually do a shot of whiskey and a beer if I am not in the mood for a cocktail. They didn't have Jim Beam's Devil's Cut so I settled on Jack Daniel's Honey. I also told her about the Yelp check in special that is good for one free domestic pint or a well drink. She was very excited that someone has finally claimed it. I opted for a whiskey sour and another beer. I asked her if she could change one of the TV channels to a news channel and she happily obliged. If she stayed  this review would have easily been four stars  but it was the end of her shift. A male and female bartender took over. Their focus became on the silver hairs that kept on trickling in -- the regulars I guess. I asked to look at the food menu  and everything was pretty pricey for bar food. The cheapest burger was ~$10... no thanks. I finished my drink and called it a day. The total was only $10.50 because they had good specials and my free check in drink. One star for the location since it is walking distance to the house and one star for the initial bartender.

Well  same story...they will not accept the coupon. From what he said  Amazonlocal was not depositing whatever percentages they owed from the promotional sales. Luckily  I was able to get a refund from Amazonlocal.  Those who have purchased a voucher for this place  don't even bother to order  just get a refund!

By the way  for all you die hards  perhaps the food is decent  which is why  to be fair i have not rated it  but most of the salad items are not even available....Hmmm...False advertising on both counts  here?!?\"",

I wasted most my lunch break roaming around uptown  now on foot looking for the restaurant. It is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd  not really S Tryon  which is probably what caused all my confusion. \\n\\nBut alas I made it! For my first trip I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. The Chicken was awesome  the tikka masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. \\n\\nI went again today ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala again  the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but my stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately  hope that passes.The sides were Aloo Bhindi (potato/okra)  Navratan Korma and I got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars  I swear it was pushing five pounds of food. I should have weighed it once I got back to the office. The chicken once again was great  korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made it stand out. But the aloo bhindi is what I was excited about the most. I had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east  probably because my mid western GF had never heard of it. It was very good  almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant/potato curry but not as spicy.\\n\\nFor someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently I mean six months  I enjoyed Nirvana II. Sure it's the first Indian restaurant I have ever dined at (Woodlands I am looking at you next) but I think eight dollars  ten with the Mango Lassi for more food than I can eat in one sitting is a great deal.

That hasn't been the case so far at this Decatur location  but we usually arrive around 5:30 to beat the crowds who do show up by the time we're leaving.  \\n\\nEating here is fairly straightforward:\\n-pick your seafood and order by the pound:  shrimp  crawfish  oysters  clams  lobster  blue crab  king crab legs  snow crab legs  and Dungeness crab are your choices.  Your server will inform you up front if they are out of anything that day.\\n-pick your sauce:  Rajun Cajun  lemon pepper  garlic sauce  or the Whole Sha-Bang  which is a combo of all three sauces.\\n-pick your spice level:  non-spicy  mild  medium  and XXX.  \\nFried options include catfish  shrimp  chicken tenders  calamari  oysters  and hot wings.\\nSides are gumbo  Cajun chowder  corn on the cob  potatoes  sausages  Cajun fries  lemon pepper fries  sweet potato fries  steamed rice.\\n(Yes  I just summarized the menu.)\\n\\nI usually get a pound of shrimp with mild Whole Sha-bang sauce  steamed rice  and a corn on the cob.

What's so great about this place is that there are always so many other Asians there  mainly Filipinos from what I saw the last time; it feels like I'm at a family party.  Any opportunity that we get to eat rice and seafood with our hands is a good one  apparently.  There are TVs everywhere  so you can watch a good game or ESPN while you nosh.

Spoke to a man who assured me the date I scheduled my bill pay would not cause me to receive a fee. Sent out rent and was no problem. One month later bill pay sends out the rent a day later due to a holiday and they charge me stating that the rent shld have be be received PRIOR to rent due and NoTsent out prior which was not what I was originally told. Apparently the two men I spoke to before about this situation were BOTH fired or left the company when i told them what i was told they said that Ishould have asked for a supervisor and will not give me my fee back. I was under the empression that these were the people in charge of these situation since they were who I was tranfered to. Although I was careful and even pay  extra for rent every month they do not appreciate the business of their customer.. A single mother working two jobs and they take my money with a smile and brush me off. I expressed to them that I didn't understand how I am paying for the mistake of their employees.  They apologized and said  that they do not usually run their business this way yet they still refuse to refund me the fee stating \\\"\"\"\"i will speak to my supervisor but i know they will not waive the fee. ironically enough I was under the impression that I was already speaking to a supervisor. Now I have to spend the  remainder of my lease on edge because I can not trust them and I have broken fans and curtains that have not been fixed. These were broke the day I moved in (6months ago) and they still haven't fixed them. The possibility of them blaming me are higher and higher everyday they neglect this situation. I wish I knew how deceitful they were before I moved in. If you do decide to do business with them make sure you include a third party..preferably a lawyer. Not joking.

After playing telephone tag for two days  with a package delivery pending the next day  I physically went to the site and spoke with Adrian Maldonado. He backed his driver completely  but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.\\n\\nThe driver  who I now know is named Clark  didn't say a word until I asked him to apologize. I was told what a good driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and I had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job. I had his bosses guarantee. When in response to the supervisor asking me if I was satisfied  I said  \\\"\"\"\"No  it was my understanding that Clark would be apologizing personally \\\"\"\"\" the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss  I could be assured that Clark wouldn't do these things anymore. I again reiterated that this is not what I was told would happen.

Note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so I don't know if their staff is still the same. Phew\\n\\nSo my date and I show up really late on a Thursday night. The place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar. We order a couple sake bombs  2 rolls (spicy tuna and a salmon roll) and some korean-style ribs. The sushi was pretty tasty (very standard  nothing out of the world) but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat. Still  it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night  so we were pretty complaisant with our choices. They had a couple choices of sake which I appreciated  so we went with the drier (less sweet) option. With HH prices  it ended up being about $25 for the both of us. Pretty darn good. \\n\\nHalfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it. Don't get me wrong  it was freaking hilarious. Then  another staff member (not our actual server) invited my date and I next door to the Living room  where she proceeded to tell us her life stories and flirt with all the owners. (Sushi & Living Room are owned by the same group of people). Needless to say we had a great time  but it was all incredibly random. Their staff was fun.

I have only had one server in this place do even a halfway decent job  and I think he was actually a dishwasher or cook filling in for a server during a desolate lunch shift. Every other time  the server takes upwards of 20 minutes to bring drinks  it's like pulling teeth to get a pitcher of water delivered to the table  and forget about asking for refills or silverware or condiments -- they'll stop by the table and only take one person's request  then disappear for another 20 minutes  after which you'll need to remind them of your request. \\n\\nThe most disappointing thing happened just yesterday  when one server who was working a dinner/happy hour service announced that she was sick with the flu that's been going around as she delivered my colleague's salad to the table.

I told him I would only be interested in adding TV service with the existing internet service if I can get ESPN and sports channels. He assured me several times that I would get sports channels with just $30 extra on top of the internet bill. Our household doesn't watch much TV so I wasn't interested HBO or anything but he offered that as well. So I agreed to have TV service installed. I asked him to schedule it for the following Wed as I'm off on that day. So I run my errands and waited for the installer to come between 1-3. By 2:30  I was afraid he's not showing up. I looked up the email to double check the appt time and I realized he scheduled it for 9/25/14  Thur. I was like what?! Why did he schedule it for Thur when I asked him Wed? So that was the first frustrating part. So I called the customer service and rescheduled. Anyway  the installation tech was very friendly and helpful. He apologized he didn't get the order to install for multiple TVs which I told the \\\"\"\"\"marketer\\\"\"\"\" guy couple times that we have 3 TVs. Nonetheless  he took the time to properly install the service. Now is the most frustrating part...NO ESPN or any sports channels! When the markerter was making the sales pitch  I asked him and told him I'd only sign up if I get the sports channels and I mentioned ESPN multiple times. Why? Why? Why? Why did he waste my time and promised something totally false than what he delievered? When I called the customer service again  a couple different guys tried to resolve the issue. They were helpful and apologetic but I wasn't willing to pay $60+ extra for TV service we don't watch much of. So I ended up cancelling the cable right away.\\n\\nMaybe there's too much \\\"\"\"\"pressure\\\"\"\"\" for Cox marketers to make the sale? I really feel like he lied just to make the sale. I asked Cox tireview the call he made on 9/19 and correct the issues. Customers should not be lied to and mistreated. Overall  it was very much of wasted time and a lot of frustration. I will never ever sign up with anything over the phone  esp. through the Cox marketers. \\n\\nI've been using Cox service for many years in the past and I am a happy internet customer. I think they provide reliable and fair service for that so I will continue to use Cox for their internet service.\"",

My household went through 4 dvr boxes. 4. That all broke. All of them. 100's of hours of TV. Lost. Every. Single. Time. Their solution? Downgrade from contour. That's their genius solution. So my solution? Upgrade to Dish for TV. PROBLEM SOLVED. However they charged us $200 to disconnect claiming we were on a contract. Nope  disputed that. However to dispute it you have to literally mail a letter to corporate. In the mean time  they cut off my Internet service for pay bills AND THEN DOUBLE CHARGED ME FOR THE INTERNET. WHAT? EXCUSE ME? How does that even make sense? So  an angry phone call and 2 hours on hold  I get the Internet back on because I work from home and to refund the double charged service they have to send a check  via the mail  to a local store.

With about 5 minutes of effort   he credited our account for $300. $200 for the bs fee   $50 for the double charge and another $50 just because he was sorry. That's customer service. That's being a great human. He's the man  and my opinion of Cox has changed. ALWAYS GO TO A COX STORE. ALWAYS! They know their stuff and actually care. They are not the call center idiots. They are true experts and will always get the job done. Thank you Mario at the Gilbert Cox Store. Thank you so much",

        "text": "\"To whom it may concern. Today my family and I visited your lake pleasant and Happy Valley Location. I'm sad to have to be reporting that our dining experience was far below satisfactory. Let me begin by telling you the manner in which your \\\"\"\"\"Lead Brooke B\\\"\"\"\" presented herself in front of paying customers has left us with a sour feeling  in our stomachs and heavy hearts for the other 2 employees Sam and Jenn for having to report to such a person.\\n\\nOur experience began after ordering we observed  Brooke tell Jenn (while Jenn was cutting paper we're assuming for trays) that she should pretend she was getting payed while at work and go actually work. You could see on Jenn's face she was mortified and holding back the tears. I went and grabbed the manager on duty and I apologize I didn't get his name. I told him what I heard and he said Brooke's just having a bad day and apologized on her behalf.. Okay being the understanding person that I am I get being in a serving  industry you have good an bad days  just like any one we human. But to my dismay Brooke's lack of professionalism didn't end there.\\n\\nBrooke had asked Sam to hurry it up with the shakes that making shakes wasn't rocket science. Moments later Brooke asked Jenn to go outside to clean the tables. Jenn cleaned 2 but one family was still eating. I witnessed her taking the food they were done with and went back to the register as the line was getting pretty backed up...\\n\\nWhen Brooke noticed the out side dining area was still dirty  Brooke grabbed the manager and said I can't believe her (Jenn) if I could I swear I'd smack the shit out of her..\\n\\nThen walked to Jenn and pulled her mid sentence helping a customer and let's go outside and chat about what I mean when I ask for something to be done. At the very second I couldn't take it I stopped her and said. You are ruining our dining expirence. How dare you talk to your colleges like this.. Brooke started laughing and asked if I was serious.. I replied this is no laughing matter and you should stop smiling immediately. As a business owner my self I am appalled that she thinks this is funny. I told her my family  are paying customers and have the right to enjoy our meal but instead I have been taking notes on her behavior. She said she was sorry but that's how she is she was just kidding with them and everyone likes it or leaves it. I told her she should be apologizing to Sam and Jenn for acting that way and the rest of the diner for literally ruining all our meals. at this time an older couple behind us started clapping an thanked us for standing up for in there words those 2 poor girls.. I told Brooke that once we left I  will be contacting the franchise owner. She grabbed her badge and said here is my name and its a corporation not a franchise. My family and I left utterly disgusted.\\n\\nThe attitude and complete lack of respect for her colleges makes me sick to my stomach. We will never be returning to any other smash burger and negativity travels fast. One oh shit moment erases a life time of compliments. I will be sharing my story with anyone who will listen including social media  yelp and the BBB.\\n\\nFor the sake of those 2 wonderful employees sake I hope this message is heard and that Brooke is reprimanded accordingly.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach me by email at Mrsbrittanytafoya@gmail\\n\\n\\nThank you for you time \\n\\nBrittany Tafoya\\nCEO and Owner of ATR Preschool\"",

We arrived about 15 minutes before the show and ended up in the lower portion of the theater. (When we bought our tickets they told us we could get a refund or exchange if we didn't find seats). So the good and the bad:\\n\\nBad:\\nI didn't care for the ticket purchasing process-too few cashiers.\\nI didn't care for the Will-Call process either  there was not a dedicated cashier  therefore  the next available cashier took the next will-call person until that line was empty. It should be electronic or one dedicated person on busy nights (we were there on a Saturday for a 7:10 show).\\nAfter getting our tickets  I was confused  the ticket said group 3  there were three lines of people with letters  but I didn't see where our theater was. (We were given no direction after we told the ticketing agent it was our first time.) We gravitated to these lines of people and saw another agent who seemed to be lining people up  we showed here our tickets and she told us our movie had been seated and to go to the hostess booth (hosted booth at a theater?) \\nWe went to the hostess booth and they told us the theater number. Given the show had already been seated  the ticketing agent could have told us to proceed to the theater  and saved some frustration. \\nWe entered the theater  which was full and luckily found a couple of seats. \\nThe chairs is our section were office chairs  with wheels. I like concept  but really didn't care for the chairs themselves.\\n\\nThe good:\\nYou are given a menu with your tickets. After sitting down  we reviewed the menu. For a theater  I thought the selection was good  they had burgers  salads  chicken  etc... I felt the prices were very reasonable a burger and fries was $10. \\nWe ordered a fruit and cheese plate  a burger and fries and a bottle of wine. We split everything. I liked the burger and there was a lot of fruit. I was really pleased with our meal. The service was good.\\nI thought the servers attending to the other people below us would be in the way during the movie  but from our seats   I didn't even notice them. \\n\\nOverall  I really enjoyed the experience for a reasonable price and I would prefer this theater over my beloved Harkins. We will definately be going back!",

The seats could be more comfortable  they recline but then they bounce right back. The other seating is just like your computer office desk at home. The food is hit or miss. They failed to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more like american plastic cheese sandwich. The other food was good  but the service is rather fail. Ordered the 4 appetizer combo  and they came out with three items. Yet again no apologies  what is with service these days? \\n\\nThe screens are great and just like a regular movie theatre  it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie. It makes the 3D glasses reflect like crazy. Overall it's worth a go  a bit pricy (for the food/drinks) but enjoyable none the less. I just bought 10 movie passes on GroupOn. Oh Yeah.",

Basically you get a soda or iced tea + a ticket for $5. It's normally $7-$10 for a ticket and $3 for a soda so it's not a bad deal.\\n\\nYou can't buy your ticket online w/the Groupon  but the theater has recently switched to 100% reserved seating. You can check if the theater is full or not before you leave home by selecting a movie time on their website then getting to the reserved seating page and it'll show you how many seats have been purchased.\\n\\nThe food they serve is mostly stuff you can eat with your fingers. The prices seem high  but the portions are kinda big. Like none of it seems intended for one person to eat alone. The food itself is not really bad but not like mind numbingly good either. I've never had anything soggy or gross like some other reviewers had  and I've even been there for midnight showings.\\n\\nSo  the negatives.\\n\\nWith the new big releases  sometimes they take like a billion years to clean the theater out before the next showing. This is \\\"\"\"\"normal\\\"\"\"\" at other theaters  yes  but at other theaters you have your snacks before you walk in the door. Here  it means you can't sit down and order something before the lights go out  which is often inconvenient for the other patrons.

Also  like other reviews have noted  the office chairs suck  and the LED service lights can be annoying.\\n\\ntl;dr = Buy a few Groupons  sit in the love seats.\"",

He was talking with some patrons at the bar and had no clue what was going on in the restaurant. He approached our table (still no menus in hand) and apologized. Then went back to the bar and got side tracked and it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come to our table with menus.

He said he would try it out to see how she acted around the other dogs & if it didn't work he would just be put her in a kennel after grooming until I picked her up. I show up at 9am Monday morning drove 25min from my house to get there & when I arrive its a woman working who asks a few questions and I tell her everything I did to the guy while making the appointment. She then has another guy come out to say they have no kennels (which I made an appointment) so I should come first or at least have been told to schedule for another time. But then starts saying since she's not fixed she can't be there anyway and then goes into talking about her temperament. Then asked if I was going to breed her & it would be in my best interest to breed her soon & get her fixed because she will cause problems in the future. Which thanks for the advice but if you can't groom my dogs which is the service I came for why are you lecturing me about my pets & I've had my share of animals I don't need your input on MY pets. Very unprofessional and should really get all their staff on the same page. Even if my dogs were spayed/neutered I would never take them there after that interaction or recommend them to anyone.",

She loudly and  in an accusatory tone  commented on any flaws in my cut or hair quality but drew a blank when I asked her for suggestions. \\n\\nThe ugly: My blowout lasted a few hours. It was pretty--that's about it. I paid extra just to have the stylist touch a curling iron for my blowout and my niece's so I did feel completely stilted. To my knowledge  this is the only blowout bar that charges extra for hot tools. The stylist didn't use any product pre-blowout and it showed. Checkout took forever. It was during that time that the woman working the front desk told me her suspicions about a competitor writing reviews on Yelp. \\n\\nThe bottom line: I've been to plenty of blow dry salons in the valley--this was by the far the worst.

We've been here many times before and never experienced service this poor.   The manager said there were no issues in the kitchen which was clearly not the case.  After offering us the free dessert the manager never took the time to come back and check in with us.   Had he bothered he would have been told that it was taking too long for everything.   When we went to find the manager he was eating dinner in the bar.   Glad he was apparently happy.  It is a shame  because this isn't what we've experienced in the past.  Won't be going back.\\n\\nWe were contacted by Vito's as a result of this review and an email I sent them directly.  I've added a star as a result.  I do appreciate their follow up.  They reviewed their videos of the dining room and we were not there three hours.  Closer to two and a half.  We were also not the only group to complain.",

The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  \\n\\nThe food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. \\n\\nThe drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.\\n\\nService was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  \\n\\nLunch\\n\\nThe lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.\\n\\nOverall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.",

I feel relaxed here and I enjoy a place where you can sit down and just unwind over good conversation  because it isn't obnoxiously loud here. It is like a patio should be. The beer is tasty  and there is a feelgood vibe on this dog friendly patio. \\n\\nFunny story.\\nI sat here with some veterans and enjoyed a Friday afternoon as the sun went down. When I was paying my bill I realized that the waitress had charged me for a drink to little. I told her about it  and she replied with \\\"\"\"\"Sorry  consider it military discount\\\"\"\"\" and a smile. Needless to say I tipped her well. \\n\\nThe negative.\\nThe men's room has one toilet and one urinal. This means that there will be a line on occasion. Another thing  that other awesome yelpers have said before me  is that I don't like valet parking. I don't. \\n\\nIn Summary -  it's a pleasurable visit. I would take out-of-towners here for a light meal and drinks before going somewhere else. Not saying that this place dies down as the night progresses  I just don't have that knowledge.

Thinking that this would mean that this place would have nice thin and crusty pizza  I drove in to get some for my drive.\\n\\nSurprisingly  they sold the pizza by the slice.  Most wood fired brick oven pizzas are sold by the mini-pie.  I asked for a slice and the gentleman behind the counter took a slice off of the heating cabinet and gave it to me.  I thought that was odd (I would have expected it to be placed into the oven to be heated).  I picked up the slice and immediately felt the droop of it.  The slice was just warm but more importantly  it was socking wet.  I gave it back to the guy and asked him to put it into the oven and make it extra crispy.  He did so and put it on a cookie sheet and put it into the oven.  3 minutes later he took it out of the oven and gave it back to me.  Now the slice was hot but the same drooping mess.  \\n\\nWOOD FIRED pizza should be crispy on the bottom and the crust - not wet on the bottom  droopy and a doughy \\\"\"\"\"crust\\\"\"\"\".  Normally  it should be thin and crispy and served fresh.  This pizza is thick - like stuff I would get in a supermarket frozen department.\\n\\nI also ordered with this slice a Gyro.  I didn't think that gyros differed much from place to place but this was a semi-disaster too.  Unlike the pizza slice  this was much dryer.  There wasn't that much tsatziki yogurt sauce and more importantly  no lettuce at all.  It had 2 half slices of Tomato  some onions and of course the lamb but it felt half full.  Anywhere you go in LA and NY (where I'm from)  Gyros are usually stuffed  lots of lettuce  tomato and yogurt sauce.  This felt like an imitation gyro in my opinion.\\n\\nI hate to leave negative reviews but this place I couldn't find anything good about it.\\nThe place looked nice but unfortunately  the food was not.\"",

They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place  put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!\\n\\nUpdate: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy  very dense shell.

The people that want the grit of the image but still enjoy a decent cocktail. I have a hard time wrapping my head around it  and yet it does amuse me. \\n\\nOverall I will give this place another shot  because it has great potential.. and since I imagine the clientele and atmosphere changes with the band  I might have just caught a slow night. \\n\\n*** For you metalheads out there.

This is not a posh version of a true rock bar  this is a fictitious Hollywood-up version of such establishment. For better or worse. ***",

Everything went very very well  our little guy was treated in the best possible way . (The doctor even let me go in the recovery room to comfort my dog.) It was serous surgery but our dog is doing GREAT now.\\nWe do have to see Dr. Mc Comb  fairly often as our dog  has several issues that require frequent visits. Dr. McComb is an excellent diagnostician and a very skilled surgeon . We send many people there with confidence.  Everyone we have sent there has had nothing but very good things to say. If you get the right Vet ..you save money because the malady is identified  and treated sooner and the animal suffers alot less.  Our experience at Crossroads Clinic has been very good and very consistent . \\nPlease give another chance to someone who might have had a bad day or maybe is not feeling well on that day.

You get a free tire rotation when you purchase an oil change which I thought was great since I had just purchased mine November of last year.\\n\\nThe receptionist was great as usual  she stated I would receive a call when the work was done and everything would be done in two hours  Juan who was one of the people I spoke with said the same thing  two hours and we will contact you.

I paid 399.99 which I thought was a good deal for my two front brakes  rotors  and oil change.  It beat the dealership by about 100 dollars. \\n\\nAs I drove off my steering wheel started to violently shake  because of this my car turned into the next lane and almost caused me to be in an accident with a public bus.  I immediately called and spoke to Juan  he stated nothing could be wrong with the car because they test drove it and everything was fine.  I told him I would bring the car back  at this point I was upset because I was already off work and was trying to beat traffic along with the pouring rain that was coming in.  \\n\\nI got to the shop  I test drove it with a really nice individual who actually had great customer service.  He noticed the steering wheel was shaking violently and he said they were going to see what was wrong.\\n\\nOne of the weights had fell off one of the wheels and they failed to put it back on.  They were able to place the weight back on  but how do you miss this? \\n\\nWhat upset me the most is that Juan had told me they had test drove the car and it was fine  obviously they never test drove it because if they had they would've definitely noticed the steering wheel had a mind of its own.  This could've caused an accident to anyone.  Another thing  there was no accountability  no one ever admitted fault on their end  no one apologized  I was never compensated for having to stay there an extra hour of my time.\\n\\nUse this place for an emissions test but refrain from anything else  they have decent customer service but if someone is going to be this absent minded when dealing with your car  it's like driving around in a death trap.",

Though I thought highly of Dr. Fintelmann  the ophthalmologist  I was seeing at the office  the way the practice is run is nothing short of a disaster.  My first inkling of trouble occurred several weeks ago when I was experiencing extreme eye pain and was informed that all their physicians were at a conference in Chicago when I called their emergency number.  They said I could see an optometrist; but as I suffer from a relatively rare eye disease  I knew an optometrist could not help me.  (Optometrists are great at fitting glasses but do not have the extensive training in eye diseases that an ophthalmologist has.)  After five days of agony  the pain finally lessened  and I kept my next appointment with Fintelmann.  He told me I needed surgery  which I proceeded to schedule.  A few days later  I received a call from a \\\"\"\"\"patient advocate\\\"\"\"\" who informed me that  whereas Dr. Fintelmann would perform the surgery  I would have to see an optometrist thereafter  even for the post-surgery follow-up.  When I informed her that this was not acceptable to me  she said that I was fired from their practice and please don't call again.  She then hung up on me.  So here I sit in pain  having a serious eye disease that can cause blindness  with a medicated contact lens and plug in my eye that should be removed  needing surgery and with absolutely no continuity of care.  By the way  I have tried to find another cornea specialist (there aren't many) but have been told that I'll have to wait months for an appointment.  Not to be melodramatic  but I could go blind by then or stark raving mad with pain.  Sorry  if you need eye care  run away from this outfit as fast as you can.  All they care about is money and doing things their way  regardless.  You  the patient  really don't count for anything.\"",

Twice it took them 1 1/2 hours  and when we got the food  it was cold... DUH. Three other times the pizza we ordered arrived with toppings that we did not ask for or want. Really Happy's? Hire some more delivery drivers if this seems to be an ongoing issue with lots of people. Service is not JUST for tourists who eat your food once. Locals need decens places. BTW- Food  when it does come   is average. Not worth all of the hassle",

Bit of a let down. \\n\\nFood was ok. We had the Chicken Saltado  Aj\\u00ed de Gallina & Chicha Morada (a drink). The drink I liked more than the food - it tasted like sugar cane juice. Measly serving. Loud music  exotic ambience and Peruvian scenaries on TV screens. Seating not bad.\\n\\n The waiter was over-enthusiastic when we were first seated & there were not so many people in the restaurant. Every time we said thank you  he would say - No Thank you!! I was tempted to say - oh no Thank you and so on :) It had a Sienfeld episode type of potential! Not saying this in a bad way. Really thought it was funny  until 3 or more groups came trickling in and this one person was taking orders  serving and even making/shaking cocktails. The guy was literally zipping around like a jack rabbit trying to cope and I could see the stress. We waited for what seemed like ages for our check and finally I decided to go get the check myself (you guessed right - he was also the cashier!!!!). He did not look too happy that I came up to ask for the check and with a frown  slapped the bill on the table. I paid and turned to leave.. No thank you or any other nicety you may be used to hearing in most restaurants in this pricey Scottsdale neighbourhood. \\n\\nNot worth it! For the price and small portions they should be able to afford more waiters. And this was a Friday evening. I wish them luck.

I explained that there was a serious accident (as it turns out it was a deadly roll-over) on the highway that had caused the delay. Stared at me as if I was speaking a different language. I then read the telephone number I had been calling aloud to verify that I had been dialing the right number. She confirmed the number was correct  but said she didn't answer the phone because she was teaching the class. The problem with this was that I had called several times between 5:50 and 6:00 PM  before class was scheduled to begin. She maintained that she was teaching and could not answer the phones. I went on to explain that I had a job interview the following day and that I needed to have my new CPR card in order to be considered for the position. She shrugged her shoulders and stared. Frustrated with the situation I headed to the door and muttering under my breath. I asked the woman for her name and exited the building in shambles. \\n\\nOnce outside  I called the location again. Despite the fact that she was sitting in the front room where the phone was ringing  she did not answer. She just looked at the phone and then continued to do whatever it was that she was doing. I was furious! I sat in my car fuming trying to figure out what to do.  I decided that I needed to get the heck out of there  and make sure the world knows that Heart Savers treats paying customers like imbeciles? Yes! That was the perfect solution. \\n\\nSo here I sit  writing to say that if you value small things  like good customer service  and being treated with respect  you may want to take your business elsewhere. If this instructor is any indication of what the rest of the Heart Savers staff is like you can expect to be treated as if you are a lesser life form.\\n\\nI understand that rules are rules. If the policy is that no one may enter the class once the video starts  so be it. But is it really that that hard to greet a customer when they enter your establishment? And  God forbid  treating that customer with a little respect  compassion and understanding. A simple  \\\"\"\"\"I am sorry but...\\\"\"\"\" would have gone a long  long way in this situation.\\n\\nI assure you that Heart Savers will never receive a cent from me. Ever.\"",

I had planned on writing a review for months  but it slipped my mind until now. When I went to see Deana I brought in about 10 pictures of celebrities who I look nothing alike. I went in feeling kind of embarrassed because I've brought photos in to other stylists before and had them laugh at my expectations. Deana was the exact opposite! She was able to go through the photos and explain to me which ones she felt would work better than others  and why  and then together we decided which one to go off of. I decided to go ombre with balyage highlights and she did an AMAZING job! She used 2 different levels of lightener and 3 or 4 shades of brown so there are no harsh lines at all and it both gradually and noticeably gets lighter going down the strands  which is exactly what I wanted.  So yes  it took a long time  about 4 hours  but I am still getting tons of compliments on my hair! It's almost unfortunate that she did such a great job  because it's April and I still haven't been back because as my hair grows out it looks even better. She also gave me an amazing cut  she took awhile doing it and I was a little nervous that she may have been cutting too much since  but she cut off exactly what we had decided and was just being thorough. In addition  she educated me more about how to bring my hair back to a healthier state  and after following what she said (which was very simple) my hair looks phenomenal  even if I just let it air dry  which it never did before I saw her. I would HIGHLY recommend taking the time to go see Deana  the countless 5 star reviews say it all!",

Everything is done by just two people.  Perhaps they were just understaffed that night  but I've already been to this place twice and had the same experience in both ocassions.

I was lucky bc I ordered a pepsi which came instantly in a can. One ordered a specialty iced tea  which should already be pre made/ready to serve since it's cold. My poor dad had to steal some of my drink. But wait  it gets better! Food came out at different times for everyone and was mediocre at best. My falafel sandwich was mushy and bland. Pita was dry. Fries that were supposed to come with the meal  came after everyone finished their meal. Fries were good and plentiful  but too little too late. No napkins were provided until I had to go up to ask for them-ALSO after everyone finished their meal. They said they ran out of napkins and handed me a dirty roll of paper towels from the kitchen instead. No joke. We were expecting Arabic music and instead we got blaring explicit uncensored offensive rap which they did not change after I politely asked them to.

The owner & her daughters want customers to have first class service so no one is rushed thru & it's a real chill vibe! You notice right away the customers are all loyal long standing customers & the girls make everyone feel part of the family! I also noticed they are honest about wait times! They dont lie & say 10 min like most nail shops because they aren't pushing people thru like cattle! Extremely clean & all supplies are new & sterilized! It's best to make an appointment ahead of time! I was lucky to get in as a walk in! Asian Jackie creates art with her nail brush & it was fun watching her in action & hears the oooh & awwws!",

She said  \\\"\"\"\"You wan square  right?\\\"\"\"\" I responded by saying no. She filed my nails and then asked if the length and shape were ok (square) and I asked her to make them shorter and with a more rounded shape  not square!

I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.  \\n\\nI'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!  \\n\\nThe interior of this place is really cool  it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.  \\n\\nI saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for \\u00a34.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.  \\n\\nI went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it  it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.  \\n\\nMy companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich  tomato / barbeque style sauce.  As I said  not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)\\n\\nAnother good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.  \\n\\nFor main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact  I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think  'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants  they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.  \\n\\nMy fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable  we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above  although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.  \\n\\nWe ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely  lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.  \\n\\nThis place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location  the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful  good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!  \\n\\nAs if you can't tell already  I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.  Honestly  the only thing left to say is try it for yourself.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed and if you are then you can always take the left overs away for me:)",

Some people love to see Cacti  some people love the ocean  and some (very few) like power lines.\\n\\nOther than the massive towers running through the course this place is in fantastic shape and offers some excellent golf. I was visiting the area and wanted to play as many places as I could. The previous day I played The Boulders South which is probably the best desert golf I have come across. However  this place is great too. The layout is very challenging.\\n\\nWe started playing from the Whites (which were moved up  less than 5400 yards) for two elderly gentlemen. Many pars and a couple of birdies later I realized I wasn't even thinking about strategy. It was too short. So on the back 9  I played from the Black tees which puts the course just over 7000 yards - now this was proper golf!\\n\\nThe course is in great shape and must be played. The twilight rate is $61  which is a huge difference from over $100 which I think it not justified here because of the view.

We had a little bit of sticker shock  but the food was good enough to bring us back Sunday for breakfast again. \\n\\nIn general  we like this place  and we will be back when we are downtown around breakfast time  but likely won't go out of the way to go here.\\n\\nPS: I know there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar  and we knew that before we went to TBC  so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar  but I kept an eye on it.

I don't eat a whole lot of red meat but the Steak and the Chicken here is seasoned so perfectly.  I usually get a Steak and Chicken Shwarma.  The tzatziki and hummus on it with the fresh veggies just finish it off I like to get mine with a bit of the spicy green sauce.  BTW the Shwarmas are so big I usually get two meals out of it.  So the Shwarma is a treat for me I usually opt for Salad wich usually leaves me hungry again in an hour but here with all the toppings and meat it fills me up  the dressing here is REALY good.  I've also had the Tagine a slow cooked stew  basically the meat falls apart in your mouth it's so tender.  The Falafel here ranks in the top 3 that I have ever had.  You can also get fries seasoned or unseasoned.\\n\\nThe seasoning here on everything is perfect  the staff are nice and smile while feeding you the decor is modern yet inviting.  This is a local guy living his dream  which I will continue to support the little guy in a big buiness world.

True Shawarma is meat whether it be chicken  Lamb or beef marinated with the appropriate spices for about 12+ hours. I ordered the steak Shawarma. It was not marinated and therfore was not Shawarma. My wife ordered the chicken Shawarma and it was not marinated but a very plainly cooked chicken. They didnt even use salt and pepper. My steak Shawarma was doused with Tzatziki. It tasted ok but we were really looking forward to some real authentix Shawarma. Another thing that was odd was they didnt even offer gyros on their menu...wtf!? The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there.",

Maybe it was because my husband and I finally decided to buy the groupon that has been on there for weeks  but either way  our experience was less than desirable.\\nThe staff said hello pleasantly enough when we came in  but then the guy taking our order started to have a bad attitude and not listen. My husband knew exactly what he wanted  what type of meat on his wrap  etc.  and ordered it that way. The guy then (nearly screaming  mind you) asked him at least three more times while making the wrap if he wanted chicken or steak. We had our kids and their friend with us also (maybe the larger group caused the bad attitude?  Not sure) and the guy did the same thing to my son a few times  as well. We got combos on the meals (majority of them) and when we got to check out  my husband presented the groupon. The girl then told us with the groupon we couldn't get the combos. We were a little confused as to why we couldn't get fries and a drink and had to ask her several times before she managed to properly explain that the combo was a 'special deal' and we could only do one deal per transaction. We told her that's fine then and to ring the fries and drinks up separately. We still wanted those regardless of price. It took quite a while to get the fries  which was fine as we ate our actual food until then  but the steak shawarma itself was actually not that great this time. It was dry and kind of crusty  and I myself had a terrible stomach ache the rest of the night like I was going to be sick.\\nThe worst part was they kept belittling another employee in there in front of us and ignoring him by speaking Spanish to each other and kept telling him to get in the back. In Spanish they'd say they didn't want him up front with them and to send him in the back.\\nHonestly this visit really upset me because the other times I absolutely loved this place but I don't feel like I'd go back now due to this experience. Maybe it was a bad day for these guys but it definitely produced terrible service and a not so great meal.",

I'm not a fan of sweet poultry I guess  but everyone else liked it. \\n\\nChips & salsa - very good\\n\\nAbout halfway through I ordered a Michelada. Due to my ignorance and the misleading description on the menu (Modelo especial  lime  spices  salt)  I didn't know I was ordering the GROSSEST drink in the world. My fault  and I just drank the rest of the modelo out of the bottle  but I was surprised no one asked me about it. There was also a fly in it  but as I was with coworkers I didn't want to cause a scene over it (my fault  lesson learned). Another slightly annoying thing is that the glass windows on the side of the building slide open (which is actually pretty cool)  but the one or two times they did this to get out to the patio they let flies in  which were buzzing around our table nonstop. The servers saw us batting them away but no one offered a slight \\\"\"\"\"sorry about that\\\"\"\"\". All in all  5 dishes and 7 drinks ran us about $150. If these were main dishes  I'd be indifferent  but for the value of what you pay for vs. what you get  I can't recommend Distrito.\"",

The weather was horrible all weekend so we were really looking forward to Brunch on Sunday before our flights left since the weather was finally nice.  There were 4 of us (all women  mid 30s  corp America Professional  dressed nice).  The moment we sat down our server had an attitude.  The restaurant was busy but nothing too terrible.  He made it very clear from the beginning that he didn't work the morning shift so I'm assuming he was called in last minute.  We were there for over 2 hours ordering foods and pitchers of margaritas and his attitude was so poor to us  that we would take turns for asking for something because he would basically yell at us when we did.  During this time  I saw a few people get up and leave before ordering food as well.  After 2 hours of the mental abuse  we got our bill which was well over 200 dollars  tipped 20 percent  and left.  However  I'm still just extremely upset about this.\\n\\nHere's the thing; we all have bad days  I understand that.  But that is no excuse to ruin someone else's day because of it.  My girlfriends and I had been planning and looking forward to this trip for several months.  I work very hard as well and this weekend was one of the very few days I've had had off in months.  It was our vacation.  He literally just ruined an enjoyable afternoon for my girlfriends and I for absolutely no reason at all.  Instead of us spending the afternoon catching up because we hadn't seen each other in YEARS  we spent it being scared to order more drinks  coffee  or food because our server was so mean to us.\\n\\nI just can't believe how horrible this experience was.  I want my vacation day back. =(\\nThe only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because their food and drinks are good.",

That should have been a telling sign that possibly it was time to look elsewhere for dinner.\\n\\nBefore our appetizers arrived  we enjoyed the cornbread with chipotle honey and citrus butter. This was tremendous  and we had hoped a prelude of the meal to come.\\n\\nWe started with the fish tacos and octopus appetizers. We're fairly educated foodies from NYC  with a great appreciation for an amazing Phoenix food culture after living here for nearly three years  and have eaten in some of the nicest restaurants in the world. We both agreed the Rubios fish taco is better than that served at Distrito. The fish was alright  but the tortilla was stale and overall  it was dry at best. The octopus was fine  nothing to write home about.\\n\\nWe shared the Skuna Bay Salmon and the Garlic Prawn entrees. I kid you not that we couldn't finish our salmon entree because it was so sweet. In a pasilla pepper broth  I would have expected some heat... not a piece of candied salmon with raisins. This was very disappointing. The shrimp entree wasn't bad  but we both agreed it tasted no different from the tequila citrus shrimp that we  not formally trained chefs  make at home.\\n\\nThe entire meal lasted less than an hour. The service reminded me of what you might receive at an Applebee's. We never had even five minutes to enjoy alone before we either brought our next course or approached. I stood up to use the restroom in the middle of the meal and noticed that much of the staff was sitting at the restaurant's bar. Regardless of how empty a restaurant is  and this one was completely empty  I would never allow my staff to sit at the bar.

Drop in  get the new-student special  and try a few different instructors & class styles to get a feel for all that's offered here. \\n\\nThe crowd: Refreshingly low-key. This is not Bay Area snobby yoga with everyone doing headstands and pull-ups before class starts. (There is no pull-up bar.) People are generally respectful  and don't chatter during practice. The 7:30pm classes are the most crowded  but they're not packed. No need for blue tape on the floor telling you where to put your mat. \\n\\nThe style: Pretty much all classes are a standard Baptise vinyasa flow  which is much more athletically intense than the stereotypical sit-there-and-ohhm yoga. More on that here: http://y1now.com/what-is-baptiste-power-vinyasa-yoga/  \\n\\nThe instructors: All great. Each has his or her own take on the style. None are robotic. Importantly  none come across as yogier-than-thou  so it's always an inviting place. The owner and the instructors are very dedicated to the practice and to the students. \\n\\nThe Heat:  It is what it is. At 95 degrees  it's not Bikram  but it's hot. You'll sweat. Sometimes you might get light-headed and spend a few minutes in child's pose because you didn't eat a banana first. So bring a water bottle  and take rest when you need to. The pay-what-you-can classes are a bit cooler  around 80-85 degrees.\\n\\nThe Price: Not the cheapest yoga studio. But the price includes a hand towel  filtered water  a block  and that high-quality mat cleaner spray. Not to mention a 95-degree room. This stuff isn't cheap. There are student  teacher  and military discounts; as well as 30 and 90-day all-you-can eat packages.\\n\\ntl;dr it's great. Go.",

Pourquoi Pas did  and in a very good way.\\n\\nIt started with ordering a latte. I was met with a simple question: what kind of milk? The options that followed were not the \\\"\"\"\"skim  2%  whole\\\"\"\"\" that I'd expected  though  but rather  \\\"\"\"\"house-made almond/coconut  soy  or cow's milk\\\"\"\"\". Hearing \\\"\"\"\"lait de vache\\\"\"\"\" come across  with a slight prickliness to it  caught me off guard. (Of course I know milk comes from cows  but never when ordering a drink does that fact come to my attention.) I stumbled. I fumbled. \\\"\"\"\"Regular  you know  um  milk.\\\"\"\"\" Herp de derp  smooth move  Katie. \\n\\nAfter tripping over my obviously non-vegan beverage order (callous carnivore as I am)  I looked at the menu more closely and noticed that cow's milk carries an extra surcharge  and is indicated by a weepy broken heart on the chalkboard. I was tickled by their apparent display of ethics (and judgment?)  and determined to try their lait maison the next time  so I could be a cool and compassionate coffee snob  too. I also noticed that their standard coffee was an Aeropress  which gets props from me (I love my home Aeropress)  and also noticed the striking lack of other options on the menu. This is  uncontestedly  an espresso bar. A one-trick pony  perhaps  but that one trick is a showstopper.\\n\\nThe latte set before me -- made with creamy dairy goodness stolen from the mouths of bleating calves at their mothers' teats -- was phenomenal. Perfectly balanced  not bitter in the least  and made with a perfect microfoam swirled into lovely latte art. Mmmmm. \\n\\nThe next time at Pourquoi Pas  not even a week later  I tried their house almond and coconut milk  and was impressed. It made great foam  and had a rich but sweet nutty flavor. But  for all that  even with the added bonus of self-righteousness for not exploiting our bovine friends  I regretted not getting cowmilk. Sweet  delicious  calorific  uncompassionate cow's milk. I'll placate my conscious by imagining that the extra charge goes toward buying the most wonderful  single-origin  free-range  fair-trade  grass-fed  eco-conscious milk from the happiest cows in Quebec.

Sorry  getting a little judgmental.\\n\\nSpeaking of  when seated at a table for four (was surprised they sacrificed one for just me  a walk-in) I was provided an iPad which contained all the menus for all the beer. I didn't see anyone else with an iPad though  which I thought was peculiar. Frustration kicked in when I tried to order two beers and they were out of both. Why not have the menus update this information? Regardless  the \\\"\"\"\"beer cicerone\\\"\"\"\" was able to help me pick something comparable. They have many canned beers  which they take pride in. So what did I do? Ordered canned beer. Why not-it's Vegas.\\n\\nHad the Poutine for the appetizer (which was enough for one person's entree): thin  seasoned fries with duck confit  thick cheese curds  a sunny side egg and a gravy that the waiter poured on the dishin person at the table. He even asked me if I was ready (which spooked me a little-uh  ready for what?) This  my friends  was THE. BEST. POUTINE. Everything was perfect  especially that spooky gravy. It's also hard to find poutine stateside that has quality cheese curds.\\n\\nEntree was their version of Chicken (Quail) and Waffles: buttermilk fried quail and waffles served with greens with lemongrass butter and Moose Drool (a brown ale from Montana) syrup. It was ...good  but not great. I think I was just wanting fried chicken and waffles and not have to fight with quail bones (no fault of theirs.)\\n\\nFor my (and your) finale was a Chocolate Stout Layer Cake with Malted milk ice cream and  AND  caramelized bacon rice crispies. To be honest  the only  ONLY  reason I got this? To see what bacon crispies tasted like. I was already full of food and beer. I knew the chocolate cake was going to be rich and decadent and yes  the crispies did indeed taste like bacon.\\n\\nI waddled back to Caesar's a happy man.\"",

When we got there the place looked nice and had a very large beer selection  so I was a fan.\\n\\nBUT.......since the vast majority of our group was there on business the check needed to be split so receipts could be turned in. There were a few couples there  so I think we needed it split 8 ways. We were told that they could only use 3 different card and that the tables could not be split. Our group was sitting at 3 four tops put together  and a long bench seat on one side. I feel like it would have been very easy to split us and still keep us all seated next to each other due to the bench seat.\\n\\nI understand that rules/policies are what they are and are put in place for a reason.

It may be the best gratis bread basket I've eaten at a steakhouse.  The cheesy muffins were out of this world good  I wish they would sell them so I can bake them at home.  Watch out you don't fill up on bread at this place.\\n\\nTo start  we had the garlic bread and calamari.  The garlic bread was stacked liked a small jenga tower  and sitting in a bed of cheese sauce.  It was crunchy and delicious when dipped in the sauce.  The calamari was likewise good  it had some peppers in it  but I wouldn't go so far as to call it Rhode Island style.  But  the peppers added some nice spice.  The breading was crisp and adhered to the calamari well.\\n\\nTo eat  we had the porterhouse for 4.  This was a good amount of steak for 4 people with sides  but if you are looking to eat a 25 ounce steak or larger on your own  it's not a good selection for you.  I preferred the NY strip side of the porterhouse  as I always do.  But  both sides were perfectly cooked to medium rare and had a nice char.\\n\\nFor sides  we had the lobster mac n cheese (which was a special I believe)  the creamed spinach  and the famous tater tots with fat boy sauce.  The fat boy sauce is basically sour cream  large pieces of bacon  and shredded cheese mixed together.  The creamed spinach was fantastic  maybe the best version of this dish I've ever had.  It had a great crust on it and excellent flavor.  I had seconds  which makes the meal healthy because I had a vegetable  right?  \\n\\nThe mac and cheese was solid  but I've had better at many other steakhouses.  The tater tots were the real winner for me  they are large  but were perfectly fried and done in the middle.  You could taste that they are made of potato  which is not the case with most fast food tater tots.  The sauce was great on them as well.  I think returning to OH for a burger at lunch and enjoying these may be in my future.\\n\\nWe had baked Alaska for dessert.  It's always cool seeing it lit on fire  but this dish doesn't do it for me.  Not just at OH  but anywhere really.\\n\\nOverall  the food was fantastic  and the service was great.

My boyfriend and I decided to visit here for some drinks and food on New Year's Day. After 10 minutes of being neglected at the first bar (where only one other person was sitting) we decided to move to the other bar where we were finally able to sit and order. My boyfriend had ordered something off the entree menu  which was good  but not worth the 18 dollars we spent on it. That night my boyfriend woke up around 2 am violently ill  waking up every 5-15 minutes to run to the bathroom. I had only had a small bite of his food  and found myself feeling nauseous all night just from that. When I called the next day to inform them  the manager Lucas was very apologetic and said he would have his boss call me to see if there was anything they could do. \\nI don't typically spend a lot of money on food but we had spent 100 dollars between food and drinks that night. When the director of operations (I believe his name was Chev or Chef) called me the next day  all he cared to say was that everything was up to standard and that there was nothing he could do for us. He claimed his temperature logs were accurate and that there were no other claims so it wasn't something he could help with. He stated it was probably a bug or the flu and that his food was not the cause because everything was \\\"\"\"\"up to standard.\\\"\"\"\" He seemed to care more about defending the quality of his food rather than attending to a customer that got very ill from it. \\nI've had food poisoning before and know what it looks like. Jolting up in the middle of the night to throw up  and then to be repeated every 5-15 minutes afterward until halfway through the next day  is not common for the flu or a bug as the director of operations tries to claim. \\nAfter wasting 100 dollars this visit  and hundreds of dollars spent here before with larger groups  I will be sure that I never visit here again. \\nThe only pleasant people I would like to give credit to are the manager Lucas that I spoke with and our second bartender Ryan.

Inside  it feels just like a Spanish tapas bar (as long as you don't look out the window on to Portobello High Street) you can transport yourself straight to Granada.\\n\\nThe menu is great and offers a good variety of traditional Spanish tapas options as well as some more unique dishes  something I really like in a restaurant. Similarly  they have a well chosen wine listed  sourced from Spanish vineyards. The beers are the standard Estrella  Mahou and Alhambra along with a couple special editions I didn't expect to see. And well priced with my 250ml of white coming in at only \\u00a34.60.\\n\\nTo eat I had marinated anchovies  Potaje de Garbanzos - a chickpea and vegetable stew  Ensalada de Invierno - a mix of saut\\u00e9ed greens and Merluza al Chilindr\\u00f3n - baked Hake with ratatouille. They were all spectacular. The anchovies were served with chopped parsley and plenty garlic - perfect! The chickpea stew was very well flavoured. It had sultanas in it and I don't usually like sweet and savoury at the same time but with a perfect balance of spices and sweetness this Moorish style dish was so nice. The mixed greens were also cooked perfectly; al dente but still with a golden char on the outside.\\n\\nThe Hake comes with a bit of a story. I was aware it would take a little longer as it was baked in the oven to order (great) It was the last dish to arrive after a very slight wait (only about 5 minutes longer than expected). Despite not having a problem with this at all  our servers were incredibly apologetic  took it off our bill and gave us a complimentary bowl of olives! It was definitely worth the wait. It was beautifully cooked; creamy white  flaky flesh and served with a ratatouille that was massive on flavour.\\n\\nI have to give a special mention to those olives as well. They are huge  I don't know what they were marinated in but as far as olives go  they were spectacular.\\n\\nI went through a period of eating my way through Edinburgh's Spanish restaurants and Malvarosa is certainly up there with the best. It has the whole package; great food  great staff  great atmosphere and good value. I think i'll be looking for excuses to visit Portobello more often.",

A local vibe permeates the environment: the chef is a Johnson & Wales graduate and the bar serves NC craft beers.  The menu is interesting and accessible  with a few varieties of down home sliders accompanying other worldly options like chicken & waffles and handmade pasta.  Once your order gets to the table  watch out; the food is rich  developed  and flavorful.  BUT... a month after opening  there are still some service-type kinks that they haven't yet worked out.  \\n\\nFriday night  I called to see if a party of 3 could be seated and was told that they were filling up  but if we got there in the next 10 minutes we should be fine.  7 minutes later  we walked in the door and were told there would be a 15 minute wait.  Not that big of a deal  we went to the bar for a drink.  The bartender was very nice  but sadly couldn't transfer our drinks to the table once we were ready to be seated  so we had to close out - again  not that big of a deal.  Our waitress (unenthusiastically) told us the day's specials and then took our order... which is right about when everything fell apart.  They brought only two of our three dishes to the table  of which only one was correct.  So they then took the pimento sliders away but not-so-sneakily tried to pawn them off on the table behind us - alas  the pimento sliders were not what they'd ordered either.  Apparently  our third order had never gotten put into the system  so they scrambled to make that and finally brought out a plain burger  having prepared it so quickly that they left off all the burger toppings (cheese  bacon  lettuce  and tomato) that were supposed to come with it.  So  now we send a second plate back to the kitchen.  Ultimately  we finally got the right sliders and burger with all the proper fixins  but it shouldn't have to be that difficult.\\n\\nHowever  the food was good enough to assuage those problems (it didn't hurt that they comped us the burger on our final bill too).  Assuming they work out the kinks  this place may need to be renamed Bigs  as I can see it being huge in the Charlotte restaurant scene.\"",

        "text": "\"All over  people are raving about Five Guys Burgers & Fries. My friend up in Washington says she loves them. On their website they show off everyone singing their praises.\\n\\nI must not get it.\\n\\nI've been wanting to try them for quite some time  and learned they now have a spot open on the Strip (not the touristy part everyone knows  but a little further past Mandalay Bay at the Premium Outlets South). As that is on the way to my gym  I decided to roll out early  stop at Five Guys  and work it off at Fight Capital.\\n\\nWalking in  you feel good about the place. It's kinda diner-y  simple... tables  chairs  and a team of employees hurriedly working on food in the kitchen. Kinda In-N-Out-esque. REALLY In-N-Out-esque. Like  you wonder if you walked into an In-N-Out instead of Five Guys. There was only one person ahead of me in line  and the cashier  Michelle  was quick and pleasant. I ordered a Bacon Burger  which if you leave it that way  is just that: bread  patty (actually two) and bacon. Anything else on it you have to make sure to specify  so I added my standard toppings -- lettuce  tomato  and BBQ sauce. An onion ring might have been a nice touch  but hey  I don't run the place. Didn't see mustard on the list... hmmmm... well  it's probably by the ketchup  because I didn't see that on the list either. I also ordered some Cajun fries and a drink.\\n\\nSo  let's start with some of the good things here. First off  the employees are very efficient. One person barked orders at the other  everyone had their station  very assembly-line style  and I got my food quickly  which was great because I was famished. Secondly  the Coke machine is  without a doubt  very cool. It's one of those new Coke-brand stations with a touch screen. You touch the soda you want  then you choose regular or with flavored syrup  and POOF -- it's Cokeapalooza! I went with a cherry Coke Zero. Wise choice. On my second visit I noticed there was Diet Barq's (root beer with BITE!)  but no cherry option  and I was really diggin' on the cherry Coke Zero  so I went back to that.\\n\\nThe Cajun fries were some of the best I've had in a really long time. Zing-y  spicy  good with or without ketchup. Definitely was loving the fries.\\n\\nDefinitely was NOT loving the burger. Sure  it was a nice surprise that the burgers came standard with two patties  but they were kinda dry and lifeless. Apparently standard setting for their burgers is well-done. Any cook or chef will tell you that overcooking ground beef will cook out the juice and flavor of the meat  and that's what happened here. Bacon was overcooked as well. And by \\\"\"\"\"overcooked\\\"\"\"\" I mean \\\"\"\"\"burnt.\\\"\"\"\" Fortunately I had sauces to back me up  BBQ sauce and.....\\n\\nOh yeah. That's another thing. There's no mustard in the entire restaurant. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MUSTARD IN THE ENTIRE HAMBURGER JOINT. No pump  no packets  nothing. I looked on the Coke machine to see if they had it stashed on their touch-screen. I thought about asking  but that would require the only non-assembly-line employee to leave her cash register. Plus  I thought  I shouldn't have to ask for mustard in a friggin' burger joint.\\n\\nFinal blow: Price. I ordered burgers  fries  and a drink  thinking  meh. $8. Should be okay with that. Oh no no  my friend. Everything is a la carte and you will order and take it up the wallet  my friend. By the time I had finished my order I was $11 in and there was no turning back. it felt as if the place was called \\\"\"\"\"Five Guys\\\"\"\"\" because you'd be paying the paychecks for five guys. Now  I would expect to pay $11  maybe more  at Holsteins or Burger Bar  where I would also not be looking for a \\\"\"\"\"quick bite\\\"\"\"\" and know I would get more (much more) bang for my buck (all eleven of them). This was not $11 quality. Nowhere close. Ironic  as I stared at the sign that said the Washingtonian or some other print media said in 2007 it was the \\\"\"\"\"best bargain\\\"\"\"\" around. Apparently in Washington you make a bazillion dollars an hour there. (Hmm... maybe The Gazillionaire is from Washington...)\\n\\nSo yeah. A mediocre burger with overcooked patties and overcooked price points. And no mustard. The employees saved it from being a one-star review though.\\n\\nI probably won't be back here anytime in the near future; if I am it will be because someone dragged me there. I'll be the guy with only the Cajun fries  playing with the Coke machine.\"",

Registered on line so I didn't  have to wait in the office  that was 11:00am. The got back to me and said to come in at 1:40. They didn't see me until after 3:00.   They say many places in their office to register on line avoid all the waiting yada yada yada. Finally  I was seen and I said I was ill and think I might have had food poisoning  she said we'll give you Ciprofloxacin for a week. I was in there for severe diarrhea (the major side effect from Cipro is... diarrhea).  I wasn't aware of that at the time. I also found out I was never seen by a Doctor  it was a nurse fpn who saw me  didn't ask what I ate or anything and prescribed the meds. I told her I didn't know for sure what I have and she said well this is how we treat  E coli. I didn't know you could tell you had Ecoli by looking at someone!!! Needless to say I got worse after 3 days I called my dr. who was out of town it was a Friday so I had no choice but to call Nextcare back and said I need to speak to a doctor now. I waited 2 hours for a call back. When you call you do not get directly to the office  it's a call center or something. I told them the diarrhea was worse could they prescribe something different? I waited and waited on the phone finally they said (by the way it was not a doctor I was speaking to it was someone in the office) no you have to finish the antibiotic and also eat a clear fluid diet for the next 48 hours. If not better call your physician to be seen. I was so upset at this point and sick and thinking this is just wrong. I did the clear liquids and finished the meds and honestly I was so sick. I got in to see my family dr. on  a Monday he said they don't prescribe something like cipro unless you have been ill like that for about 4 days at least  without testing me they didn't know what they were treating me for anyhow. Then he tells me that if I didn't need Cipro  which he didn't seem to think I did  he thinks it was a stomach flu (viral  not bacterial) you can become seriously ill from taking that antibiotic. You can get Cdif. I won't go into details but it is a very serious condition! So the medicine they gave me made me worse.   I am hoping this all clears up for me and just wanted to write this review to let you know before you go in there. Too many mistakes for me  I take my health seriously and I think they should too. I will never go back to this place  never.",

Lots of good  locally sourced brisket with cheddar  garlic and caramelized onions  and again that perfectly grilled focacia. My kids love this sandwich.

My adopted puppy is wonderful  thankfully healthy  and the process of adopting was easy and straightforward  however Moondoggies absolutely disappeared after I paid my adoption fee and spay deposit and failed to follow through on any of their commitments. At the adoption meeting  I was told that she was microchipped already  and as soon as she was old enough to spay the rescue would arrange a spay appointment for me with one of their vets (I was told I was welcome to use a vet of my choice  but in that case I would be responsible for covering the bill).  The foster mom also said that she would follow up in a week to make sure that the adoption was going smoothly. I never heard from them. I sent many e-mails (about 5 or 6 over the course of four months) and left several phone messages asking for her microchip information and for details on how the spay would be scheduled. They also never responded when I was having difficulty activating my free ShelterCare pet insurance. Despite their lack of communication  I was still giving them the benefit of the doubt thinking that they were extremely busy  disorganized  or something of that sort. Once the month of her spay approached  I started to become much more suspicious of their behavior and decided to investigate. That is when I found these yelp reviews  and I couldn't believe that so many other adopters had the exact same experience! \\n\\nI talked to my friend who is an attorney  and he suggested that I notify Moondiggies that I will take them to small claims court if they do not follow through on their promises designated in the contract  our e-mails  and in our conversations with the foster mom. Low and behold  I get a response within one hour of sending that e-mail! I was very frustrated that they had been ignoring all of my previous communications efforts  but I was happy that they were offering to follow through with the spay and microchipping. Unfortunately  after one or two e-mails promising to schedule these appointments  they again dropped all communication.  I still intend to follow up with our attorney.\\n\\nI have wanted to give this rescue the benefit of the doubt because it is run by volunteers  but after these experiences I am very doubtful of their legitimacy. If they are in fact a rescue  they are very poorly run and are  even if unintentionally  still cheating people out of their money and not following through on their commitments. What concerns me most is that due to their shady behavior with me and so many others who have posted reviews  I am doubtful that they are a legitimate rescue. I contacted petfinder.com to see if they had any more information on this rescue  and they informed me that due to many complaints Moondoggies has been removed from their site (I definitely commend petfinder on their great mission and the responsibility they showed in investigating questionable rescues). I truly hope that this is an organization that is really trying to help homeless pets  and that these reviews will help convince them that they need to change the way that they are running their business.",

They have a decent sized patio in the front that is not utilized. The place would look so much more welcoming if something was done with the front of the building. So we get in and are seated. Not long after three more parties show up and are seated while we were dining. The service was fast and friendly as our waiter quickly came over to take drink and food orders. I asked some questions about what was vegan on the menu and the waiter pointed out a few items and we picked out two  and my mom got a lamb dish. \\n\\nThe two dishes we ordered were the Masala Aloo Gobi  which is a potato and cauliflower curry   and Chana Masala  which was a chickpea with curry spices. My mom and husband also ordered some bread for the table  which I didn't eat because it contained dairy. The food was ok. I was surprised by both how simple they were and the portion sizes considering our entrees were ten dollars each. I felt like I could have made this at home for no more than a few dollars of ingredients. I was also expecting some heat in the dishes  but there was none. There was a nice curry flavor but I didn't feel like the dishes lived up to the name of the restaurant. My mom liked her lamb dish but also said that she has had better elsewhere.

Set an appt with Sam and came in the next day. He was very chill and I could tell my son lost all his anxiety after talking to Sam. I told Sam what I wanted for my sons hair and he executed it perfectly. He is now my boys barber. Loved the vibe of the place and everyone their was super friendly and chill. I am also thinking of checking out the dance studio for hip hop lessons for him as well.",

Unfortunately they did not live up to all the hype  we were both expecting red velvet pancakes but got pancakes with food coloring we were pretty disappointed.

The omelet was pretty tasty how can you go wrong with cheese bacon and avocado   nothing that great but it was good. \\n\\nOverall it was an ok experience I was pretty disappointed I expected it to be way better because of all the reviews on yelp.

I ordered the short stack version of the bacon pancakes b  and yo' I thought they tried to play me son!  So they gave me the short stack  3 pancakes nahmean?  I'm like cool  and then they had 2 ripped pieces of bacon floatin' on top yo like somebody bit my bacon and left me the fat part.  The FAT part son!  I'm like  yo I thought the menu said bacon infused pancakes b!?  I didn't see no bacon bits creatively infused into the pancake son  matter of fact  I'm glad I didn't complain off top!  Because they did have bacon in the pancakes but it was one whole piece per pancake like as if they cooked one side  waited 3 minutes  threw a piece of bacon on it  flipped it  then cooked it another 3 minutes.  And my bacon was mad chewy son! C'mon son!  If it's Filipino inspired  you know we like our shits crispy b!  Almost burnt to the point where it gets a little ashy nahmean!?  It felt like I was eatin' rubber pancakes with a toy piece of bacon I got from my youngn's fake stove  you understand?  Anyway  I ate it all  cause I was hungry.  Good thing my main event came through tho.  The Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was right on the money.  I wish they gave me more macaroni salad tho son  they gave me a baby scoop b.  I'm 26 years old fam!  You can't give me the baby scoop with the adult main event son.  I ate that shit in one bite and had nothin' else to off set the adobo flavor.  But yo  I ain't even tryna play this place son  because I saw some other shit on the menu that was probably way better than what I got.  I'm also Filipino  so grabbin' some Filipino food probably wasn't the best idea because my moms be makin' that shit since I was 3 yo  so I'm not really impressed by it nahmean?  All in all  if you tryna impress a shorty yo  do NOT take her here unless you don't care about her or you live 5 minutes away and she says \\\"\"\"\"If you buy me breakfast  I'll tickle your fancy\\\"\"\"\".  That's the only time you take a broad here yo.  Anyway  yo the waiter was cool  had my water filled up before I had to ask so you know I was pretty satisfied.  But overall I give this place a 3 out of 7 rating b.  #MoochEats\"",

Yes there is quite a wait but my friend and I were catching up so it went by quickly.  From the looks of the menu  I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii  it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash  eggs  & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed  and like another Yelper noted  reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good  like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend  also from Hawaii   ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again  the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.\\n  \\nI am not completely turned off by the place and want to give them another try.  Perhaps the pancakes were just bad that day?  I want to try other items on the menu.  I think it's great there are Hawaiian-style breakfast items on the menu even though the owner is not from Hawaii.  Oh yeah  we were told that the chili on the menu is Zippy's chili!!!\\n\\nI will be back here and hope to upgrade this review.",

I suggested we try Redemption Arcadia  as it is closer to both of our apartments than the Tempe location.\\n\\nI had gone to a Bible study a few months earlier with the main pastor (F_____). I thought we'd give this place a try.  but Arcadia's main pastor was announced as being on vacation. \\n\\nWith the guy that was there instead  the first thing I noticed was that the pastor that day walked on stage and immediately began screaming at the congregants. And I mean in less than 10 seconds from the time he started speaking.\\n\\nI was actually flinching when he would speak. At some points he leaned forward about 45 degrees toward the audience and waved his arms emphatically  yelling 'WELCOME to Christianity! If anyone told you it would be different  THEY LIED...THEY LIED!\\\"\"\"\" If I had not brought my girlfriend with me  I would have simply walked out at this point. Someone needs to take some video of this guy and show him what he looks like. With two huge speakers above the stage  there is absolutely no reason to yell like that. Plus  he looked crazy when he was waving his hands around...like the type of person you avoid on a downtown sidewalk in a major city.\\n\\nFor nearly 90 minutes  this man's antics made me absolutely sick with anxiety  particularly since we had fasted before the service after reading that there would be communion that week. The pastor's tone seemed like depictions of the stereotypical 'abusive husband' in movies or TV [ie. 'Dinner ready is PIZZA?!?\\\"\"\"\"] \\n\\nAdditionally  what made the yelling worse was that the speaker addressed his audience at a 9th grade reading level and his points seemed a little redundant. Was he raising the volume of his voice to compensate for an argument that was not otherwise compelling? The pastor also kept talking about the band \\\"\"\"\"Linkin Park\\\"\"\"\"  and I'm not even kidding...\\n\\nAlso a few other things I couldn't help but notice (since they were screamed at me). The pastor presented a (probably fake) narrative about getting into a car wreck on some kind of missionary trip  but *repeatedly* (like 6x) said that it was on I-95. In Iowa. Well  I-95 goes nowhere near Iowa. It runs north-south along the east coast. Did he mean I-35? Who knows? I once had a car totaled by a drunk driver on I-10 many years ago  and to this day  I remember correctly that it was on I-10. The pastor also related rather awkwardly that a \\\"\"\"\"black Nigerian\\\"\"\"\" (is there any other kind?) helped to pull people from the vehicle afterward. \\n\\nAt another point in the \\\"\"\"\"sermon\\\"\"\"\" the pastor  who actually professed himself a patriot  offered that Americans were less apt to be give selflessly of their own resources  when they harbored some typical American tendency to \\\"\"\"\"keep what's mine and look out for my own\\\"\"\"\". Anyone can look up the stats and see that on a per capita basis and GDP-percentage basis  America is the most charitable nation on earth  probably the most charitable in human history  in fact.\\n\\nFinally  what the sermon lacked in insight  it thankfully made up for it in brevity  as the pastor (\\\"\"\"\"Hey  I'm killin' it on the time thing today!\\\"\"\"\") concluded his remarks after about 40 minutes or so of caterwauling. I don't think I'll be going back to the Arcadia location.\\n\\nI almost forgot...the pastor also said that his toddler son had a \\\"\"\"\"demon heart\\\"\"\"\" because he sometimes did not want to give 10 percent of his allowance to the church. No  sir  your son is not a demon. He probably just hopes--perhaps naively--that if the building's electricity bill goes unpaid  maybe your microphone will be turned off.\"",

I'm not saying I'm pretty but I would like to look at some good-looking people.  \\n\\nThe music was mediocre as well.  There were some old school hip-hop  but it was just a mix of EDM with hip-hop and some weird mixes.  Not my thing.\\n\\nOh  and here's the kicker:  The bartender would not give us regular tap water.  If we wanted water  we would have to pay $8.35 for a bottle of water.  Um ... no thank you.  That really turned us off.   Plus  what I cannot understand is where did the cents come from?!  I thought bars charge an even price so what's up with the 35 cents?  \\n\\nYeah  I don't think I'll ever go back to 1Oak.  I cannot wait for Hakkasan to be open at MGM in April.",

I had pulled up The 1OAK website on my phone to get information  meaning what time they  open  music  and what not. I could not find a 'dress code' section on the website.\\n\\nWe drove to the Mirage  and was instantly turned away by the doorman. Not because I was dressed poorly  but because I was in \\\"\"\"\"flats\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nMy designer  not cheap \\\"\"\"\"flats\\\"\"\"\"..........\\n\\nI would understand if I was in a pair of dirty flip flops  but I wasn't.\\n\\n I had told him that I recently had a procedure done  and he said that it didn't matter. WOW. Is your place ADA approved??????????\\n\\n It was the \\\"\"\"\"dress code\\\"\"\"\"  (that I can NOT find ANY where  might I add. I'm looking on my laptop right now.) Their dress code is not posted outside of the club  on their website  NO WHERE. He said that I would be a \\\"\"\"\"liability\\\"\"\"\" because I wasn't in heels and that the club has had \\\"\"\"\"glass break.\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nWhat? What does one even have to do with the other? I'd much rather step on broken glass in flats than high heels....or is that just me?\\n\\nI am absolutely disgusted that because I can not physically wear high heels that I  as a customer was turned away. That I was a \\\"\"\"\"liability\\\"\"\"\" because I was in flats  when I'm sure you know that some of these girls are a liability in themselves  because they can barely walk in those damn things! \\n\\nIt's funny that the one thing I did find on their  website  was Rob Kardashian in a simple black tee  and a baseball cap  but I am not allowed to wear flats? \\n\\n..............Pretty interesting dress code.\\n\\nI just wonder that if I would have brought a cane  or if my friend had pushed me in a wheel chair if I would've been turned away too  since I wasn't in heels. The doorman didn't even offer me a manager  or some one to speak to.\\n\\n I am surely disappointed  this  was truly a \\\"\"\"\"1 Of A Kind\\\"\"\"\" experience. I truly felt discriminated against  I never plan to return to 1OAK  and I plan on letting a lot of people know about it.\\n\\nI have contacted 1 OAK  and they said that they do plan on ***adding a dress code section to their website.... Something  in my opinion  should be posted anywhere and everywhere in the first place. \\n\\n^^^^^^^^^*EDITED**  5/21/13*^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nHere's the quote from their website \\n1 oak las vegas . com\\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"Our Dress Code can be described as \\\"\"\"\"upscale chic.\\\"\"\"\" Hats  t-shirts  chains  excessive jewelry  athletic wear  shorts  baggy attire  sunglasses  sandals/flats  and tennis shoes are not permitted. Entry is always at the doorman's discretion.\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nJust keep in mind Rob Kardashian...... Black tee... baseball cap. This business isn't run correctly.

The patio has a very nice and cozy vibe and I like the decor. \\n\\nI had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars for this review... so I will break it down individually. \\n\\nService: 5 stars - our server was friendly  professional  and on top of things. Way to go! \\n\\nAppetizer: 3 stars - we ordered the pimento cheese with grilled pita points.  The pimento cheese was a bit on the sweet side which I found a little odd... I would prefer a sharper or spicier flavor. However  the pita was on pointe! It was freshly made in house and had excellent texture & flavor.  I loved the pita but not sure I would want the pimento cheese again. \\n\\nFried chicken: 5 stars - I don't normally order fried chicken  but had heard good things about theirs.  I went with 1/4 North which consists of a chicken breast and wing.  This fried chicken is without doubt the best I have had in a long  long time!  When I bit into it  there was an explosion of flavor in my mouth... wow!  The crust was crispy and seasoned perfectly. The meat was tender and juicy.    They brine the chicken for 24 hours prior to cooking it and it was absolutely fabulous.  I am not sure what they put into the coating mixture  but it was yummy - I think I detected a hint of chili powder or cayenne pepper.               \\n\\nCornbread muffin: 1 star - I love a good home-style southern cornbread. Sadly  on my visit  the cornbread was dry and tasteless... it was about as appetizing as a piece of cardboard. I took one bite and was done. \\n\\nWhite pepper gravy: 3 stars - I am not normally a huge fan of gravy  but this was pretty tasty. They serve it on the side so it doesn't make anything on your plate soggy (which I appreciated). \\n\\nMac & Cheese: 2 stars - this was the most disappointing part of my meal and I wish I had skipped it. The mac & cheese was made out of Cavatappi (corkscrew) pasta which is ok but just not what I expected.  Also  they used a white cheese as the base. Not a problem  but I would have preferred a much stronger  sharper cheddar sauce.  Overall the cheesy sauce was just not very flavorful.  I was really expecting a more traditional southern mac & cheese like the casserole-style that my grandma used to make. \\n\\nWine: 3 stars - I had a sauvignon blanc for $7.50. It was ok but served at a little warmer temp than I would have preferred. \\n\\nBeer: 5 stars - I tasted the Cottonwood pumpkin ale and loved that it was served in a glass rimmed with cinnamon & brown sugar.  Yummy! \\n\\nCost:  3 stars - I think the prices are a-ok.  Overall  I think our tab came to around $50 for 2 beers  1 glass of wine  an appetizer  and 2 entrees (before tip).",

My wife and mother-in-law ordered the fried chicken.  I had the chicken fried steak and my son had the BBQ sandwich and my daughter had the mac and cheese. A couple  pieces of the fried chicken were not cooked thoroughly so we sent it back. Two entire meals were returned to us and they comped our desserts.  They handled the situation perfectly. Things can happen once in a while anywhere but the way it is handled is what counts the most and Leroy Fox knows customer service better than most. The food was very good.

(Ok  you've probably seen (or heard about) the recent videos of the delivery drivers throwing the fragile boxes over the fence- it was all over the news last month  during the holidays.)\\n\\nThis small store is located near the La Bonita supermarket. My husband went here several times for packing and shipping services. My husband sold some limited edition statues (read: FRAGILE) for his dad. These statues (John Wayne  Laurel & Hardy  The Honeymooners) were collector's items. In addition  they were very heavy. The rep said that his packing of the statues was excellent  and claimed that \\\"\"\"\"The only way these are going to break  is if they get run over by a truck!\\\"\"\"\" Well  he was wrong. It was a big mess. The buyers had to request refunds. My husband had to call this guy up several times  and then he referred them to corporate. I think there was a total of four visits here  and only one statue made it to the buyer without any damage.\\n\\nNeedless to say  we are no longer selling fragile items of this nature. After several failed attempts  it's safe to say  we will not be using this shipper anymore. We don't want anymore headaches. It looks bad if you're a seller  and items can't be shipped in a proper manner. It's frustrating because you do your part as a seller  but depend on the shipper for service  but this company cannot deliver its promises.\"",

It was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as I possibly could  mostly because the place isn't that big  I live across the street  and I appreciate at least a foot of personal space.  Welp  that foot of personal space is almost gone now so I figure it's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar  especially since they just added the most AMAZING back room a bar has EVER had.\\n\\nSeriously  I could set up a cot  eat  drink  and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life. They have shuffleboard  darts  and SkeeBall! Really  what more can you ask for?  In my original review of The Great Escape (R.I.P.  gone but not forgotten)  I concluded with \\\"\"\"\"If they had shuffleboard  I'd bump them up to 5 stars\\\"\"\"\"...Little Woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have (and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood).  \\n\\nWhat really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly. Once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach...SUPER friendly because I love punching people.  Another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of RCL with a group of complete strangers  obviously awesome.  One stranger let me play with his iPhone 5 the day it came out just because I noticed it. I've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for Mint  so that's not the Wood's fault.\\n\\nAll in all  I love this bar  I can now loudly declare that I love this bar  and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can. Just leave the mean-mugging in Old Town.\"",

        "text": "\"AWFUL. This is my first Yelp - and I go to new places every day. I frequent places like Postino  the Parlor  St. Francis. Based on their website this looked like it fit into the same category. Nope! \\n\\nFirst off  I'll admit that on a rainy Monday I had a hankering for soup at Baby Kays. Didn't know they are gone  so I walked across and thought - why not try a new place. I was already disappointed so I'll give them that; maybe I'm just over critical today. You be the judge. I arrived at 1pm and the place was very busy. The greeter was unkept with wet hair and seemed to have no clue. I just opted to sit at the bar. \\n\\nBar: Restaurant design 101 - SEATING! My pursehook (kudos for at least having this) was between the legs. Add that my knees still hit the wall and I'm still a good foot away from my plate and I look like the hunchback of Notre Dame at a nice dining establishment. I'm 5'3\\\"\"\"\". Imagine a taller person sitting there. Not only did I drop a bite - so did my spaghetti eating neighbor. I'd be fairly interested to see how much food lands on the floor at that bar or how many more seats could they fit there if it weren't from men & women sitting spread eagle up to it.  Also  call me old fashioned  the bartender should always be behind the bar. Never was. I wasn't needing drinks; I just think someone should be there. Maybe they were severely understaffed at 1pm on a rainy Monday? \\n\\nMy water glass was never refilled; I sat right next to the 'water station' at the bar  where the waitress repeatedly slammed it down next to me. Yet my glass remain empty. \\n\\nFood: First off  I am gluten-free (not by choice). The menu is absolutely the furthest place you'd ever want to go for a gluten-free person. McDonalds has more options. Typically - Italian is not my forte with all the breads and pastas  but most all restaurants have enough options. Many Italian restaurants make their own gluten-free pastas and pizzas - Picazzo is a favorite. \\n\\nMy choice? The simple salad and their wood roasted mushroom side. What I got was a plate with a mound of oily leaves and 3 seeded olives. That's it. Oily lettuce. The mushrooms were a plate full of standard button mushrooms sauteed in...you guessed it...oil! I was imagining wood fired  wild mushrooms with a twist that only this chef could create. No flavor whatsoever. I tried to trick my tastebuds with salt and switching from one bite to the other (salad  mushroom)  sans water. It was so disgusting. Being that I waited so long to eat I shoveled it in to satisfy my stomach  give my knees a break and got the heck out of there. \\n\\nAll for a staggering $23. Would you? Sorry Chef Bianco - one lunchtime midcentral foodie fail. I have no interest in returning to this restaurant  nor trying any of the sister restaurants and am now even more eager when the long time Phoenix staple Baby Kays returns at the old Richardsons location in November!\"",

Very simple menu which is a plus. Between the three of us we ordered a pizza and some pasta and a few drinks. We found it to be a little pricey and over rated but all in all we happy with the food. \\n\\nThe place was not very crowded this night either - the patio tables seemed to be occupied and the inside had a handful of table occupied as well. Not too slow  not too busy. \\n\\nService seemed to be good until we neared the end of our meal. Our plates were cleared away once we had finished the food (as expected) and our check was dropped off at the table. We were still drinking our drinks while enjoying conversation  paid our bill  then just a few short moments later our glasses and drinks were all removed from the table without our request. The server straight up cleared our entire table without saying a single word to us. It was a moment where we were not only confused as to why she was doing this but also very irritated. It not only made us feel very uncomfortable but unwelcome. We immediately regretted the huge tip that we left. \\n\\nWe would have understood if the place was at capacity  there was a wait to be seated and they needed the table but that was not the case at all.\\n\\nWe clearly got the vibe she was sending (and it wasn't a good one)  picked up our stuff and left.

Overall a good experience. \\n\\nAgain this year I bought the VIP tickets and after reading that some things changed I anticipated being annoyed and disappointed- which happened. First  I was directed to park an obscene distance from the entrance even when the lot was not full on the north end. Easily 1/2 mile away from entrance.  I got right in however  but I arrived when it opened to try and beat some of the lines this year. \\n\\nVIP was not so much VIP however. They added more seating- out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.  Bathrooms were just port-a-potties with hand sanitizer- last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water. My 6 drinks now included soda and water  no more complimentary non alcoholic beverages. As for those alcoholic ones  pathetic. Last year a full bar was available along with beer and wine. This year? Select beers  wine  and premade cocktails in a bucket. IN A BUCKET. WTH? I'm not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.  Vodka lemonade and rum punch- poorly mixed to boot- are sad excuses for cocktails. \\n\\nNo appetizers were included this year and those $8 in food tickets? Well I used them in one fail swoop at Montana BBQ next door. The cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some. I saw a few trucks like tom's bbq giving very shareable potions for $8-10 but I got about 6 cheese curds for $4 at another truck. \\n\\nI would like to note some great trucks though- Franks hot dogs and Chuckies topped it for me. Both excellent and worth the small wait. Sammich did it awesome too.  Didn't bother with the Maine Lobster Lady. $20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it. I'm sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... I am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever I travel. I'm all good paying $10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival. Smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several trucks. Come early too since even the dessert trucks had super long lines by 2 pm. Making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun. \\n\\nI hop they make some changes for next year  especially with that VIP ticket. I feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year. The trucks will always get my business but it may not include this festival.",

I tried the Brisket  Spare Ribs  Sausage  potato salad  mac and cheese and corn bread.  For the most part everything was pretty bland and lacked a good smoke flavor.  The brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.  The sausage had a good smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothing more than you find in a store bought sausage.  My sides were overall bland and the corn bread was very dry.  \\nI was able to try some samples from my friends meals and I would say the beef rib was very well done and tasty.  The pie was also very good.  \\nThe food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past  It lends itself to questioning how long ago the food was prepared.  Also I did not get a strong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.  \\nOverall I think CSS would be a viable BBQ option for the area if they were not located right next to another BBQ joint.

As I stated in my original review  this is a place where patience is a virtue.. Well  sometimes being patient can only get you so far... \\n\\nThe last THREE times I have called in an order to go  I have been told that they were out of Kalua Pig (it was still cooking). Last time I called in an order not only were they out of the pig  and also the chinese chicken salad. Now  I can somewhat understand the pig situation as that takes hours to cook... But being out of a salad? I think management should consider changing their menu and only offering items such as the Kalua Pig as a special.\\n\\nMost of the time when I try to call in an order and Islander's says they do not have what I want  I change my plans and get food elsewhere. This most recent time I just decided to order something else. I was told my order would be ready in 35-45 minutes.\\n\\nWhen I arrived  I was not greeted. 5 people were seated at the booths furthest from the door  I walked up to them to ask about my order and was told it wasn't ready yet. And then just stares. No one offered me a drink  bothered to apologize for the wait or even offered to ring me up. The employees  and I am not even sure if they were employees or just friends of the owners  just socialized among themselves. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a little out of place...\\n\\nFinally  almost a full hour after I placed my order  the cook came out from the back with my food. If I wasn't an honest person  I would have eaten for free that night  as the cook assumed I had already paid. \\n\\nLike I said at the beginning of this update  I want this place to succeed. I like the food (the pig is fantastic  when it's available)  and on a positive note: The restaurant appears to have been spruced up a bit. None of that matters though if I can't get the items I want consistently  or if I am made to feel so uncomfortable when I am there that I can not wait to leave. \\n\\nOh  and contrary to other reviews  808 Island Craves is NOT located here  anymore.",

Initially all seemed OK  but not too long after I started to need reading glasses to see smaller print.  I figured it was just a normal progression of my eyesight  as that is a common development for most over time.  My wife started getting headaches if she wore her glasses for very long.

The experience was much better  to start.  But  then  we found that the prescriptions of my wife's glasses and my contacts were not correct.  It seems quite unlikely that it was due to changes in our eyes.  The prescription for my wife's glasses was too strong  not too weak  and her eyes did not improve during the past year.  She has new glasses now and her vision is much  much better. \\n\\nIn my case  with the correct prescription for my contacts  I no longer need reading glasses for most things  and again  the prescription is not as strong as before.\\n\\nWe are very happy with the new provider and feel we were just a customer to get in and out for this provider.",

Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better  6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth  pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better. \\nThe kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs  I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor  but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn  which tastes even better the next day.  \\n\\nService 3 stars\\nWhile I never had bad services here  I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order  which I think for a newer joint like this  a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.  Same with beer suggestion. People  this place has a beer selection!  Again  the bartender has always been ok  but an extra wow factor can make a difference. \\n\\nLocation/Atmosphere 3.5 stars\\nThis used to be levacchia. Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much. Making it a little nicer and bigger than what you think a BBQ joint should be.  It is huge frankly.  It is right next to the light rail stop.  They validate parking which is great for arena events. \\n\\nA little disclaimer: I met the owners  who invited a few people to taste the new menu.  Is my review skewed because of it.  Never. But I learned a few things about the place and felt the heart they put into everything.  And it makes me want to see this place strives. I mean  they actually promise they will always have the Panthers games on  with volume!\\n\\nCome and try them out.\\nBudget conscious alert: 3 words. LATE NIGHT MENU. 2 more words. DRINK SPECIALS. After 9 or 9:30pm. I know y'all are not in bed yet.  Oh wait  2 more words. FREE PARKING!",

I ended up with a waiter that probably knew about as much as me just by looking at the menu. I didn't ask how long he had worked there. I ended up with the treasure pot. Excellent choice. Portion size is on the money for lunch. The sushi is pretty good if you absolutely must have sushi for lunch. I had the 13 year old with me. If it passed her approval then I know we were in a good spot. Pros are good selection from a wide range of Asian fair. Cons are ensuring you time the place right as it gets crowded for lunch  ensuring you land a good waiter/waitress and asking for a little bit of a higher health score. I prefer sushi served in restaurants that are 99-100+. \\n\\nFYI  like E2  this restaurant is on the more expensive side for lunch. The atmosphere is hip contemporary.

My fiance had an \\\"\"\"\"Aivator\\\"\"\"\"  and I tried the \\\"\"\"\"Hemingway\\\"\"\"\"  both mixed and garnished beautifully. Now to the food and service  which is where it went downhill...service was very very very slow  including at the bar  where we were the only 2 customers at the time. That said  it was Sunday  Mothers Day  and they are usually closed but were open with a special menu. They were not prepared at all. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. We ordered an appetizer and it came out fairly fast and was the best and only good dish of the meal  a yellowfin tuna over asian noodles. Past that  I noted all the tables around us  some seated before us  some soon after us  didn't have any food on the table  for a very very long time. I looked back in the kitchen which you have a view of  and only saw 2-3 people working back there. Then  about 30 minutes after our appetizer and waiting  waiting  waiting  patiently  we didn't complain  all the sudden  food began appearing out of the kitchen  en masse. How odd...it was like they had made some phone calls to get more people to come into work or something. I ordered biscuits and gravy. My biscuits were hard and cold  hardly Emeril worthy  there was MAYBE  at best  2 tablespoons of gravy  also cold and getting congealed. One egg was sunny side up as ordered  the other overcooked with a hard yolk. The sweet potato hash on the side was overly greasy with bell peppers and onions  I couldn't eat more than a bite  the grease was just too much for me. My fiance had a steak and hash dish  the steak was ok  but both his eggs  ordered sunny side up and runny  were like 2 flat hard boiled eggs. My daughter had the burger  which was cooked as ordered and ok  but just a burger  nothing special and her fries looked and tasted like they had been in the fryer 3x as long as they should have been  or cooked dirty unchanged oil  they were so dark and overcooked. We didn't order fruit  but fruit came out anyway  our waitress noted we didn't order it but alas  it WAS on our check....for $6! $6 for a lot of honeydew  a few mushy strawberries and some grapes? Needless to say  we skipped dessert and headed out. I will say this  my fiance and I did note we were there on a day they are usually closed and on a menu they usually do not prepare  so we WILL try e2 again  maybe for a date night  but if that goes in any direction this brunch did  these 2 foodies will not be returning.\"",

First of all it is a fast food place so the food should be ready and usually warm. I tried to order wings (which they advertise on the banner) but they didn't have any that day even though it was earlier in the day and in the week. The people working were very lethargic and didn't want to be there (who would?). In leu of the lack of wings I decided to get 1 slice of pizza and a salad which was a combo for around $9. The salad came with either a vinegarette or ranch and I chose vinegarette. It was a goopy texture and the taste was so sweet it was like molasses. The salad was so bland and had basically nothing on it. The only hints of flavor came from the onion and tomato. The pizza had rubbery cheese and it was slightly cooler than room temperature.\\nI did not have a good experience here and I do not think I will be coming back.",

I figured it would be easy so I tried  swiped my credit card  and I was told I placed the order incorrectly and was told I would have to place it again. not only was I in a rush at that point I would have to speak to a manager to get the credit from the first order that I placed incorrectly.

Already  they were out of fajitas  tortillas  fruit  and pancakes.  We picked up the scraps that were left of everything else and took a seat.  Thereafter  it took about 30 minutes-and a couple rounds of propmting our waitness-before we even received our water and memosas.  \\n\\nThings then went from awful to pathetic.  The buffet line proceeded to run out of every single item at the same time.  It remained completely empty for at least 30 minutes!  So now  90 minutes into the service  there was NO food.  It was a \\\"\"\"\"no-ffet.\\\"\"\"\"  That's when the memosas dried up.  Although they did give us margaritas to make up for the memosas  the margaritas lacked any discernible alcohol and were overloaded with ice and margarita mix.  That aside  how do you run out of memosas 90 minutes into a 5 hour breakfast service?!?  It wasn't even like the place was busy.  While we were there  they had maybe 20 guests at max!\\n\\nThe worst part of all of this was the dishonestly revealed throughout this whole experience.  The groupon promised a buffet that \\\"\"\"\"stretches across the restaurant.\\\"\"\"\"  In reality  the buffet had 8 items and fit onto maybe a 6 food table.  Even if it had food (which it didn't)  it would have been a disappointment.  What was worse was that even after the \\\"\"\"\"no-ffet\\\"\"\"\" ran out of food  the hostess continued to sit people-providing them no warning whatsoever that there was no food.  It was almost comical to watch their complete disregard as they sat people  only to watch the people walk up to the buffet line that lacked food!  \\n\\nIn short  if you want a buffet that lacks food and drink  this is the place for you!

A stylish race suit and helmet (with built-in headset to communicate with your instructor) are provided.  The instructors (who ride with you our on the track) are spot-on with their psychology and ultra-encouraging - not to mention brave!  Driving the F430GT is unforgettable - and you'll never looking at motor racing on TV the same way again!\\n\\nI also did a \\\"\"\"\"Hot Lap\\\"\"\"\"  as passenger to Dream Racing owner (and former Formula 1 driver and Formula 3 world champion) Enrico Bertaggia  who showed me how it was really done.  The Hot Lap eclipsed any thrill ride out there  yet I always felt safe in hands of a master.\\n\\nNone of these race car experiences are cheap  but I can't imagine any are better value than Dream Racing (and they even chauffeured us to and from the Las Vegas Strip in a V12 Mercedes  which was an experience in itself!)

Being a corrupt hustler  drug dealer  womanizer  cop killer  etc. isn't something to be celebrated.\\n\\nAlso  I cannot believe people brought their kids here. The images displayed are violent  graphic  gruesome  and bloody and the movies and interactive displays are loaded with cursing.\\n\\nThe week after Christmas the museum was SO crowded too.

I am gluten free and they had an extensive line of Jewel's products along with their beverage choices.  My husband and I would come in and grab some Joe and a little treat and I'd be SOOOOOOOOOOO happy that I could eat a cupcake or roll with my coffee.  I can't do that at about 99 percent of coffee shops around Phoenix.\\n\\nHowever  again this past fall  there is a switch up of who is in charge and now I cannot get any gluten free products now.  Now I wait again until someone gets on the ball and offers all of us gf peeps a place to get our treat on WITH our java.\\n\\nWhen I asked about it I was snubbed and told that they were making all of their products now and gf wasn't going to be an option.

We are a huge fan of BYOW places  because it allows you to focus more on the food/experience rather than counting ridiculous wine bottle prices. So I had this place bookmarked for a while.\\n\\nWe decided to try it out  and it was unique and really great. \\n\\nAs soon as we walked in  about 8pm  with two wine bottles  we found the owner playing violin for and joking with a table in the middle of the place. We walked in and he stopped and said  \\\"\"\"\"Ahhh! You must be hungry too! Sit!\\\"\"\"\" It was funny and welcoming and warm. We then sat and opened the wine and he came and explained the menu  which features about 5 main courses  and other things like soups/salads etc. All the stuff is home made food. NOTE: This is a small place by a guy and his wife  and they make the menu every night. \\n\\nUsually  that's not exactly my thing  either because of a stand off-ish vibe  or something. But this place really had a lovely aura. We though we were in an Eastern European town for a couple of hours.\\n\\nMenu features mostly meat items  but there are vegetarian options  as my wife is vegetarian. We had two vegetable soups  I had stuffed cabbage (lamb and shredded cabbage with garnishes and sauce) and my wife had a mushroom dish (portobello mushrooms cooked in sauce and served with potatos). We shared a salad  and then we had a crepe desert to share also.\\n\\nIt was an amazingly excellent meal. I swear to God one of the best food meals I have ever had anywhere. My plate was HUGE  and I eventually ate it all  slowly. Even though the vibe was different  the place was so chill  so friendly  and the food was amazing. We sat and talked and drank wine over the course of two hours and had a great time. And at the end  for two people  the bill was $35! It was really great.\\n\\nWe then walked out  feeling super energized and good. And walked down duluth street to the park. It was a really great evening  and we were surprised.\\n\\nWe're totally sold now  and will 100% revisit several times. It's a great unique experience. Go there. Do not expect a situation though where you can be rude to the owners and treat them like they work for you. Diners with that approach might be met unkindly  which one of the reviews below suggests to me could be the case.\\n\\nThree other tables came in while we were there  and everyone of us was loving it.

Fortunately I was able to be seated with no waiting  but the place was pretty much full.\\n\\nThis time  I tried Spicy Shio with extra green onions and gyoza.  \\n\\nGyoza:  pretty good.  But I would have to give this gyoza battle to Monta.  It's very possible they Sora will get better as they have been open only a week  but Monta's gyoza had more flavor and juice.  \\n\\nShio ramen:  I'm not a big fan of shio ramen  but I have to admit that this was pretty good.  simple  not oily  with some of the tonkotsu flavor coming through.  Spicy Shio is a weird concept as it makes it somewhat spicier and fattier  which is somewhat like ordering a veggie burger with extra cheese.  I  think I'd stick with Miso personally  but I do like their noodle.  Al dente  slightly chewier than Monta's miso ramen noodle  and wavier.   I think  it is more like a traditional miso ramen noodle from sapporo.  People who are not fond of heavy  kotteri type broth will probably prefer shio ramen.  Not me.  \\n\\nService:  today they had a one Chinese lady waiting the table  and other two were Japanese.  This is somewhat disappointing for an authentic ramen house  but it's not that big of a deal as the menu is short and simple.  However  the service seemed to be faster today.  Perhaps they are getting used to it after the opening week.  \\n\\nAs I was leaving  there were a few people waiting to be seated and the parking lot was full.  There is plenty of space to put in a few tables  and I really think that they need a counter space as all authentic ramen houses should have.

We went to pick up the car at the time expected  simply hoping for the best.  When we got there  the Hertz employee gave us our car  no problem.  When we expressed our concern about the lack of a call back and the confusion about picking up the car  we were ignored  and the pick-up-the-car process continued as if nothing was said.  No  \\\"\"\"\"Sorry for the inconvenience  we'll look into it.\\\"\"\"\"  Just continued on.  I may have even looked around the room for confirmation I was really there.  I felt as though nothing we said during the process was actually heard  questions were not thoroughly answered.  And all of the directions given by the Hertz employee were so confusing that each time I heard one I looked at my girlfriend  she thought for a second  then interpreted.  \\n\\nAnd somehow  a reasonable price for a rental astronomically increased with additional charges for this and that.  Maybe usual  but it just seemed strange.  No thanks  Hertz.  Please improve service.  And return phone calls.  Or get rid of your voicemail.  Please fix.\\n\\nIf you go here  you will get a car  and it will likely drive.  But everything in between just won't be excellent.\"",

We ordered 3 different meals  lomo a caballo  arroz con mariscos  and pollo a la brasa.  The lomo a caballo would have been pretty good  but the sauce they had was sweet  which I didn't like at all.  The arroz con mariscos was bland  hardly any flavor.  The pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal  being dry and unflavorful.  we did get a free soup with our meal  which was the best thing we tasted there.  The sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them  and were not refilled until I finally had to ask.  We also had to ask for the sauces for the pollo a la brasa.  The aji that was served with the bread was pretty decent  but not enough to save the rest of the meal.  Overall  it was too pricey for the service and the quality of the food.  Sadly  we haven't been able to find a Peruvian restaurant that we like in AZ  and this one was probably the worst one we've tried.\\n\\nWow! It's a good thing you can edit these reviews.  A lot has happened since I made this review  which the last time I checked is an opinion of what I think.  The owner of this restaurant  upon reading my review  posted it on \\\"\"\"\"Peruanos en Arizona \\\"\"\"\" a group on Facebook.  He mentioned my full name in the review  opening it up to his \\\"\"\"\"friends\\\"\"\"\" to personally attack me.  He also said that that I went in to his restaurant complaining of the decoration of his restaurant. (which I didn't).   My wife made some comments  defending our opinion  and then he scanned our yelp coupon (which has my full name on it ) and order sheet that was made when we paid  and posted it on the same page as a picture  claiming that he was right about me making comments about the decoration. (which is not shown in the picture.) He claims to be a professional  but is far from it.  I had nothing against him personally  until now  but in one of his comments he says that there is no possible way that so many things can be wrong with his food unless I have something personal against him.  I don't think I need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who I personally don't like. He also posted the same review on his personal facebook page  to which his \\\"\"\"\"friends\\\"\"\"\" responded things like  \\\"\"\"\"poor gringo  he only knows what frozen hamburgers and hot dogs taste like\\\"\"\"\" and \\\"\"\"\"He doesn't have the smallest idea of what real Peruvian Food is  he probably hasn't even been there \\\"\"\"\" \\\"\"\"\"with a last name like that  what does he know \\\"\"\"\" \\\"\"\"\"He's one of 'those' customers\\\"\"\"\"  \\\"\"\"\"I hope the seafood got him sick \\\"\"\"\"  words like jealous  ignorant... things like that.  Now if I didn't know any better  I would think that a gringo's opinion doesn't matter when it comes to real Peruvian food  too.  However  I HAVE been to Peru  I DO know what good Peruvian food is supposed to taste like  and my wife  who is actually FROM Peru was equally disappointed with the food  and service.  Her mother cooks 50 times better than this guy  and we both know that what we ate doesn't compare to what real Peruvian food is supposed to be.  So  instead of taking this as constructive criticism  the owner has taken it as a personal attack against him  and has to look for validation from other people who surround him.  We probably would have been back there again  because my wife's family would have wanted to try the \\\"\"\"\"new Peruvian restaurant\\\"\"\"\" which has happened before with others  but now no one that we can tell to about our experience will ever go there.  There are also many many many other sites to review a restaurant  not just Yelp.  I'll make sure to put this same review on other sites  too.  That will also give me time to think up other things that I didn't like that I didn't mention on my original review.  Like how this \\\"\"\"\"professional\\\"\"\"\" was negotiating delivery prices with a meat driver right in front of the guests.  When I made this review  Yelp posted it on my facebook page  but I took it down because it was negative  but I will be sure to post it now.  I don't know if what this guy did was legal  but I'll find out soon enough.  I just hope he doesn't put my Debit Card number up on facebook.  So  if you're going to give this place a negative review  watch out!  You'll be personally attacked for your OPINION  and be lied about and be told you don't know what you're talking about.  He has since taken down all his posts  but I saved all the screenshots if anyone is interested.\"",

        "text": "Sushi Koma coma. \\n\\nWe sit at the sushi bar and the servers got us with drinks  some edamame and started a appetizer order for us. Where we sat at the bar  there is a sign and a plate blocking so we were hard to see  but for a while weren't really being greeted by the sushi chefs or asked if we wanted to order even though they knew we were there. I guess the ladies sensed us shifting after we've eaten most out apps and asked if we wanted to order from them. Eventually we were able to make sushi orders to the chefs  but the servers here are amazingly top notch. Super friendly  attentive and intuitive to diners needs and absolutely should be praised for it. \\n\\nWe tried - \\n\\nAPPS \\n*sashimi roll- don't think it's the size of a regular roll  it's a bit smaller  with asparagus in the middle and wrapped in white radish and it goes with a sweet sauce (eel I think) and sweet mayo. Personally would have gone without the sweet sauce and maybe done a ponzu instead. Still  pretty interesting and good. \\n*tuna carpaccio - peppered tuna slices  some ponzu  mayo and crisp garlic. It's pretty tasty of a combination  though I was unsure of the creaminess at first. \\n*seafood toastada- this was tasty with a bit spicy and sweet sauce  chopped fish on a crispy wonton. These are one per person though the menu doesn't state it... I assume the sashimi roll and tuna carpaccio are as well  but we only got to ordering one of each of those.\\n*dynamite - It's a guilty pleasure of mine  this was standard but pretty good.\\n\\nNIGIRI\\n*albacore - This was fresh and had a interesting flavor...almost a smoky flavor to it or the sauce. \\n*cajun albacore - Now this is cajun indeed! It was rather spicy! This and the regular albacore wasn't on their menu  but we asked and they had it....Perhaps ask what nigiri isn't listed as there are a few you may miss! \\n*yellowtail - Theirs was really fresh and served with ponzu and a thin jalapeno slice which was a nice kick. We kept ordering this  the favorite of the night.\\n*red snapper- I normally don't like this  but I go back to try once in a while. Here it was rather fresh and enjoyable. \\n*scallop- Whole scallop nigiri is one of my favorites. We normally ask in our favorite spot for masago/tobiko on top and a squeeze of yuzu sauce. The scallop was fresh and sweet here  but their yuzu sauce is rather sweet than citrus so I don't know if it has yuzu at all. Iwould order without and maybe do a touch of lemon next time. I generally lean towards tangy flavors than sweet when it comes to sushi.\\n*mackerel- One of my favorite things to order  here it was just okay. It was a bit stronger flavor and salty than I would like. \\n*uni - Theirs was fresh and sweet! It's a recent acquired taste I'm liking more and more  so I'm sensitive to when it's not fresh and very iodine tasting. I like theirs a lot. \\n\\nROLL\\n*Denver roll - We got this based on it having soft shell crab so I was kinda expecting it to be like a spider roll  with a big crab in it  this had more of it sliced then fried. It was alright  I like the crunch with the shrimp on top and the crab mix. I'm not a roll person normally  but I appreciate their rice ratio in rolls is rather fair. \\n*salmon skin handroll- Unlike some places where the skin has a bit a meat  this is pure skin goodness. It makes for a really chip like crisp to it. Theirs has the usual sprouts  cucumber and gobo root  but one thing I've never had is this was also wrapped with some shiso/ perilla leaf in it! I happen to like that taste and enjoyed the flavor combination in this handroll  but it may be strong to some. \\n\\nDESSERT included is ice cream or mochi. The BF and I shared a green tea ice cream and a mango since it's limit one dessert per person and I must say that I really like their green tea ice cream. Its consistency was rather creamy and smooth and the flavor was a bit floral which I'm a fan of. \\n\\nOVERALL? I thought the fish was fresh and the food was pretty enjoyable. The service from the servers are some of the best around town. We also got asked toward the end of our meal how we liked the experience which isn't usual and I think shows that they care to strive where they can improve. I presume the friendly guy that chatted us up was the owner or a manager. \\n\\n I will be back for sure  I work close by and we eat late. For now  this is a step behind my usual late night sushi spot.",

We placed our orders (2 AYCE dinners  and one dinner entr\\u00e9e for our non-sushi eater.) We ordered just a few things to get started  and were impressed when not five minutes later the first part of our order rolled out: a couple of rolls  and a gyoza app for our non sushi eater. We tucked in  looking forward to a nice meal. (OMG  tuna carpaccio with roasted shaved garlic! Amazing!) It was a busy night  but the place is small  and there were three chefs working the bar  and four servers  who were very attentive and sweet  BUT... totally disorganized. \\n\\nAll four of the servers seemed to be working our table  and while one of them would come around every few minutes to ask if we'd like to order something else  we had to keep replying that unfortunately  we were still waiting on items we'd already ordered and didn't want to order more than we could eat. There seemed to be no centralization of orders  and while having four attentive  very friendly servers is awesome  having just one server who made sure that our orders came out correctly and in a timely fashion would have been better. We had to ask for the rest of our order five times  and our non sushi friend waited about 45 minutes for his chicken teriyaki bowl. We were there for over two hours  and while the food was excellent  the efficiency and accuracy of the service was not.\\n\\nOne of the servers later apologized and explained that our entire second round order was given to another table by mistake. We waited about half an hour with no items delivered. With AYCE  at least you're not going to be charged for something you ordered  but didn't receive  but it's still annoying. We eventually got everything we ordered  but wouldn't have if we hadn't kept track of it ourselves. The food was wonderful  and the service was well intentioned and friendly  so I'm willing to give them another try  but I won't come when I'm in a hurry  or if there's someone I want to impress. I want to spend my meal enjoying my food  and not tracking down orders because one of my dining companion hasn't gotten his entr\\u00e9e. \\n\\nTuna carpaccio  seafood tostada  sashimi roll  and chicken teriyaki apps are a must!

I always order the Vito because I love Italian subs. However  if you want the meatier  thicker sub  I would go for the NightClub sub  because it's essentially the same  just with more meat and toppings. I've tried the tuna sub  which is good if you like classic tuna subs. Nothing special  just a good ol' tuna sub sandwich. I wouldn't go in with the expectations of classic Deli subs from New York/Chicago. If you want subs better than Subway though and want it done really quickly  then go here  you won't be disappointed. Oh  and one more thing... the sizes of the subs are all one length - longer than a 6 inch but not quite a foot long. \\nI think the hype is all in the atmosphere. Being in Surprise  AZ which is on top of Sun City  I doubt the loud rock music flies well with some of the clientele. I even heard some of the customers complain that the music is too loud. The manager explained that part of the JJ's chain's personality is the loud rock music. It keeps the atmosphere light and upbeat  along with their funny signs  rules  and sayings. The workers behind the counter even yell out and greet you the second you open the doors to enter the restaurant. This place is just so convenient for what it is. It's easy to get to  plenty of parking  and they even deliver 1 sandwich if that's all you order.

Reuben's are composed of thinly sliced meat that can be cooked quickly  toasted bread  thousand island sauce  sauerkraut  etc. How the hell can the line not come up with my order within TEN minutes?

I'm not sure what's with all of the 2 star ratings because honestly  this place was much better than I was expecting and for those who read my reviews  I have pretty high expectations. \\n\\nWhat was good:\\nThey offer school fundraisers. This is why we happened to go that night and they donate back 15% to schools. That's a big plus for me.\\n\\nAlthough the menu was nothing overly specia  there is a wide selection of items so even if you are watching your weight (as I am)  you can make healthy choices without being relegated to the salad section. And the food was tastier than I was expecting. My friend had a Cuban Sandwich and said it was pretty good. The bread was fresh and the meats were plentiful and tasty. My son had fish and chips. The fish was a little greasy  but overall  it was very tasty. We had to ask for tartar sauce and it didn't come with the malt vinegar but I suspect that if we asked  we'd have gotten it. I had a veggie wrap which was brown rice with a variety of mixed veggies with some kind of sauce wrapped in a very large tortilla. It was pretty darn tasty.  My friend and I both had broccoli on the side which was overcooked  but it was nice to have that as an option in a sports bar setting all things considered. We also had a steak quesadilla to start and the steak was VERY flavorful and nicely done.  \\n\\nOur server was SUPER nice and although she made a few mistakes  she took ownership and rectified the problems promptly. For example  she brought us steak nachos when we ordered the steak quesadilla. She apologized  took ownership rather than doing the \\\"\"\"\"blame the kitchen\\\"\"\"\" routine  and quickly brought us a new appetizer. She was a little slow on keeping the drinks filled but it was busy so we'll cut her some slack. \\n\\nWhat I didn't like: \\nThinking back  there wasn't much I didn't like. The food was flavorful  the service was nice  though slow  and the place was nicely lit  open  and inviting. I'd definitely go back for a girls night out situation or at least an adults night out. I guess the one thing I'd have to question is whether or not it's a sports bar or a family restaurant with a sports theme. It's hard to decipher. I guess that would explain some of the other reviews complaining about the lighting and the ambiance because it is hard to determine which theme the restaurant is going for. They do Kids Eat Free on Tuesday nights....so if it's a sports bar...you don't really want kids there. I don't know. I'm rambling.\\n\\nHere's the bottom line....give it an honest  open minded try.

Well  it may just be the other way around  first off. Anyhow....my husband and I understand it's Christmas and most people don't want to be working on that day. We get it. However  when we walked up to the host and said  \\\"\"\"\"We have reservations for 5:30 \\\"\"\"\" and he said  \\\"\"\"\"Tonight? Oh  we don't have anything available \\\"\"\"\" when we were the ONLY people there  didn't start off well at all. When I reiterated  \\\"\"\"\"We have reservations...McCormack at 5:30. On Open Table....\\\"\"\"\" he was like  \\\"\"\"\"Oh! Well  we aren't ready. Please sit at the bar first. Have something on me.\\\"\"\"\" Huh. Okay.\\n\\nSo we sat at the bar. The bartender was definitely frazzled...looked like she was still cleaning up from the brunch shift. Okay. No problem. I asked if she could make an extra dirty martini. She looked at me and said  \\\"\"\"\"I'll have to go downstairs for olive juice.\\\"\"\"\" Um...okay? Again  I realize it's Christmas  so I say  \\\"\"\"\"No. I don't want to bother you. I'll just take a whiskey on the rocks. What do you have?\\\"\"\"\" She named several I'd never heard of but offered the bottle of one to sniff. Okay. We'll take two. Ridiculously smooth...Dullamore? (Not Tullamore...we know that one.) Anyhow...it was nice and then two other groups got seated while we still sat at the bar waiting. Huh. Well  I know it's a slower pace here so we were patient and finished our whiskey and then a different host sat us. \\n\\nDinner tonight was a $50 prix fixe. Seemed decent to us. We selected appetizers and dinners. I had the foie gras...something I had heard Montreal was well known for. Ugh. It tasted like strong liverwurst. That was my fault. I should never have ordered it not sure if I'd like it. My husband had a salmon appetizer that he said was \\\"\"\"\"fishy and chewy\\\"\"\"\". Neither of us finished our appetizers  but again...probably our fault.\\n\\nSalads came out...they were tiny little piles of grassy leaves with one slice of an orange  four cranberries  and a dollop of vinegar. Meh.\\n\\nMy husband had boeuf bourguignon..but with medallions of beef as well as pork...quite good. However  the beef had several  rather tough  chewy portions...sinewy...something one wouldn't expect from a restaurant like this. I had a risotto that was more like a bouillabaisse. It was good  but definitely needed some salt. \\n\\nDessert was a molten chocolate cake...that came out like two little bear turds....no lie. And they tasted about as wonderful (or at least I think bear turds probably taste like this). They were flavorless  unsweetened globs of chocolate that I took one bite of and left. I NEVER leave chocolate. EVER. \\n\\nOkay....ALL of this could be tolerated because it was Christmas...no one wants to work on Christmas. I get it. The death knell came when I asked the waitress for our check. She asked  \\\"\"\"\"All on one?\\\"\"\"\" -____- Are you kidding me? We are a couple out for dinner on Christmas. Do you think this is a blind date?? Do you think that  because I'm older than my husband  we're going Dutch??? I became severely annoyed at this...but my husband said the girl was young  she doesn't know. We look at the bill. Our whiskeys \\\"\"\"\"on me\\\"\"\"\" (the host) were on our bill at $15 each. Really?? Okay. I calm down. I get it. Probably not your best servers on tonight. We pay and go to get our coats from the coat check. No one has time to look at us. (Mind you  the restaurant still has several open tables...) I counted to thirty with a $2 tip and my coat check ticket in my hand. I then put my scarf and gloves on and went to the coat rack and retrieved our coats myself. We walked out with no one batting an eye. \\n\\nHonestly? The food was okay. Not worth the $50  though. I enjoyed my entire night  even with the lackluster food  until the unwitting comment from the young server. I'm sorry  but for the price and snootiness of the place  they need to train their help better. I'd skip this and try one of the many  MANY other places right around the area for dinner. Just a few blocks up is  McDonald's open 24 hours...that might be a better choice.\"",

I know  I know they've only been open 9 days  but there were rookie errors that should never have occurred with an experience restauranteur or issue that a soft opening should have handled.\\n\\nWe wanted to try this new restaurant for our friend's birthday  so I diligently made reservations a day in advance (they are not yet set up on open table).  We arrived on time  but they weren't ready.  They tried to set us up on a bar table  but we wanted a regular table which we had to stand and wait for 30 minutes.  The three hostesses blamed the problem on a failed computer system  but there seemed to be plenty of tables and they just wouldn't seat us  because they said the computer problem messed up their ordering system.  After waiting a half hour I finally demanded they seat us and take our order the old-fashioned way -- by hand.\\n\\nTo their credit  the restaurant decor is lovely.  The tables a beautiful real wood rustic hand-hewn tables.  The indoor/outdoor vibe is great for this time of year.  But they do have an issue in the bar area with the direction their tables are set up.  All the tables are set up in an east/west direction so when the sun sets you are literally blinded by the sun.  A simple solution would be to turn the tables to that they face north/south.  Also  once the sun set the restaurant goes to dark  soft lighting.  Not unusual for a restaurant  but with the poor lighting and the thin font on the menu  it is nearly impossible to read the menu.  Come prepared -- bring a flashlight and reading glasses because you'll need them.\\n\\nOn to food and drinks.  The appetizers were really good.  We had the Guacamole Sol which was good  but the Warm Goat Cheese appetizer was really outstanding.  I can't say the same for my husband's drink.  The waiter recommended the Grande Clase Azul Margarita.  We like margaritas  but we did not like the taste of this one which was more of a case of quantity not quality.  It was strong -- super strong  but all you tasted was tequila and very little of the margarita flavor that we know and love.\\n\\nOn to dinner  my husband and I ordered the Grilled Fish Zarandeado.  In my opinion very average and not much flavor.  Plus it was very wet below the tortilla so when I went to pick the taco up to eat it  the whole thing fell apart.  The rice was okay  but the black beans were really not to my liking.  All together and even with the sauces the flavors were very bland.  Which was extremely surprising for Mexican food.  One kind of tends to expect spicy and flavorful food.  However  our friend had the sweet potato black bean taco and she liked it a lot.\\n\\nLastly on to service.  While our waiter was nice and a dedicated educator about all the menu items  service was very slow.  We had brought in a specialty cake for our friend's birthday which they very graciously served.  We all promptly ordered coffee to go with the cake.  20 minutes later we were still staring at our cake waiting for coffee.  We finally called the waiter over and asked about the coffee and he said they were out of coffee and it would take another 5-10 minutes to make some more.  We promptly ate our cake without coffee and cancelled the order.  To the waiter's credit  he brought us 4 cups of coffee right before we were  gathering our stuff to leave and said the manager would comp the coffee  but by this time it was 9pm and we were ready to leave.   Interestingly  our original reservation was for 6:30 and we didn't leave until after 9pm.  We like long and leisurely dining when it is our choice  not when it's because of slow service  computer problems  etc.\\n\\nI know the restaurant is only 8 days old  but it may be 8 months before we give it another try.  Hopefully  by then  they will have worked out all their problems.",

The restaurant is CRAMMED with tables so standing at the bar while you wait is uncomfortable for those trying to find space to stand  let alone those sitting down trying to enjoy their meal. Our waiter was sub-par.  When he finally came to our table  he immediately asked if we were ready to order.  Had to ask another waiter for water  and by the time my margarita was served (only because I had to ask a busser if he could check the bar to see if my drink was up there)  the ice was melted.

They present you with above average salsas and and spiced toastadas. The margaritas were good and strong but maybe pricey.  ($10.50 and $13.75) I loved the warmed goat cheese with salted peanuts and that sweet hot chipotle syrup it was like whipped cream cheese but tastier and all that sweet salty and spicy went really well together. It is worth coming here just for the goat cheese. The grilled corn was good! Not the best I've ever had but GOOD!  They are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians. Service is above average as our server Amanda was very knowledgeable and informative and seemed well trained.\\n\\nNow the tacos.\\n\\nThe tacos are Baja style street tacos. They are very small tacos.\\n\\nMy husband had the sampler plate and I ordered two ala carte tacos so together we tried five kinds.  We tried chicken  beef  pork  fish and vegetable. For the most part the tacos were just meh but the stand outs were the pork and fish tacos. We spent $30.25 on 8 MINI TINY tacos. The chicken was the most undesirable but passable. The chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty. The beef one could have been more flavorful but was OK. The vegetable (corn & rajas) taco was full of just mooch as it lacked flavor and texture. The wild caught fish taco was yellow tail on my visit. The tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked ($7.50) and it seemed expensive to me for such a tiny taco with very little fish in it. \\n\\nYour best bet is to come for Happy Hour and take advantage of it.",

Originally  I was given a room on the 15th floor  but when I tried to turn in for the night at around 11pm  I was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat. Startled by the notion that I had checked into the local zoo and not the Hilton  I went downstairs to the front desk. On my way down  I was shocked to discover that the mild  classy hotel I'd entered earlier that day had transformed into a meat auction  where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for Ed Hardy and the discount section of Forever 21. After a brief chat with Ray during which I explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the back-to-back meetings I had planned for the next day  I was given a different room  far away from the cattle auction. While this made my trip bearable  the disappointments from this so-called Hilton did not end.\\n\\nOn Sunday  I went down to the taxi stand at 10am for a cab and found myself in a line ten people deep. I waited over 15 minutes for a taxi. I refuse to believe that mid-morning on a SUNDAY is Las Vegas' rush hour. Apparently  the valet service wanted to sell a party bus to the unsuspecting guests  and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only AFTER the Hilton charged $10/person to a party of 7 to rent a limo. Thanks  dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you lined your pockets. Truly  a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the Hilton corporation.\\n\\nIf you're a 20-something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one night stand  this is the hotel for you.

Security was diligent in letting us know the door was open via phone and visits to the room. Except for the night our room at Elara was robbed. Just seems sketchy. Reports were filed  and we were directed by Mr. Hill of the security team to file reports immediately. Security also admitted the locks on the double penthouse doors aren't the greatest and are currently being changed out to better locks. He also provided the address to the closet substation. He sez 'go there now'. I discovered after a hike past Mandalay Bay  the substation is M-F  9-5. Its Sunday  memorial day weekend. They are flippin closed. Hilton refused to send a car after directing us to the closed substation. According to management  it isn't their responsibility to know the hours of operation for the police department. Understandable  but chaps my behind nonetheless. Hike back to Elara(no money for a cab) to find the fire alarms going off. I am too hot(physically and mentally) to care at this point. At the desk  I work my up the chain of command to Steven Arent  who is kind enough to admit that it has not been a pleasant stay. He was nice  but it was a nice prepared remarks tourist speech that behind it all...it was so faked/forced. However  we learned from Steven that the reports can be filed by phone  no visit to a substation required. The 2 hour walk in the baking sun was a waste. He gave us a 100$ room service credit. To be split by 3 broke people that got our money stolen to split for 2 days. Cheapskate  considering it was a 3500$  paid for upfront penhouse that got robbed.

No replies from anyone asking on yelp to 'please call because we care' They dont care. They will not return phone calls or emails.

If that isn't enough to send you running (if you are a loyal cheesesteak fan in the know) than certainly the taste of the food will get you later. I opened my small make-your own ($7) Philly (white american  peppers  onions) and the first thing I saw was a piece of fat the size of mini-ice cube attached to the steak which the owner said they hand carve all the time. Somebody must have been a bit lazy and missed a giant piece of fat. A chunk of fat that big would not get past even the biggest idiot cutting meat. \\n   The whole idea of trying to do something different with cheesesteaks is nice  but too many folks (well maybe not Phoenix natives) have specific standards for cheesesteaks and you just can't break these decades old rules and create a loyal following of true fans. Cut the meat thin like every other place in the world and pay attention to what your serving. At least the guy was nice when I called to inform him and he told me to come back and make it right. Hold the fat please.\\n\\n  Oh the fries and onion rings are straight out of the ole baggy. Makes me wonder about the ribeye - if you can't cut your own fries  why would you use the best quality meat? They might be cutting corners for a profit.??\\n\\nResponse to Owner :\\nThe only way to tarnish your restaurant's business is to serve us meat with fat chunks that you could literally choke on. Smart Yelpers will realize that is safer to eat your dinner out of a dumpster than risk choking on Phoenix fat.\\nUSDA Choice is not the best cut of rib eye  it is USDA Prime that is top of the line. Certified Angus means a black hide. Your considering non-frozen fries? why thank you so much for considering serving people fresh stuff.",

After being thrilled by Salt of the Earth and Station Street Hot Dogs (both owned by the owners of UP&C) we were expecting another similar experience.\\n\\nWhen walking into UP&C  I was immediately struck by its size.  There are two long benches in UP&C and each seat about 24 people.  Things brings about an interesting dining experience  you are literally sandwiched between other parties.  Unfortunately this causes the tables to be quite loud and limits your ability to hear the person across from you.\\n\\nOn to the menu/food... \\n\\nThe menu itself is rather small.  There are roughly 6 or so entree's to choose from.  Most of the entrees are your standard BBQ fare (brisket  bbq chicken  fried chicken  ribs...).  The entrees run somewhere between $12-18.  The problem that you run into is that everything is a la carte.  None of the single serving sides are included with the entrees.  The next problem is that these single serving sides are on the expensive side ($5 for a mac and cheese side  $3 for cornbread  etc).  This leads to a rather expensive dining experience  which in itself isn't really a problem if the food lives up to the price...\\n\\nHowever  in my experience the food did not live up to the hype.  I tried both the ribs and the brisket and found them both to be a little on the dry side  and surprisingly to be tougher than I expected them to be.  To make up for this  I tried to add a little of the bbq sauce that they provide on the tables.  Rookie mistake.  The sauce really didn't add anything to the meats and instead was at the same time too vinegary and too watery.  On the bright side  they clearly know what they are doing when smoking the meats.  The brisket had a nice char layer and was smoked wonderfully.  Hours later  my hands still smelled like smoke.\\n\\nThe sides we ordered we both acceptable  but really failed to make me feel like I was getting a good value.  The cornbread was a little denser than I like and seemed to be vaguely sweet  but otherwise rather bland.  The mac and cheese was pretty OK  but nothing that you couldn't get at a number of restaurants around the area.\\n\\nThe one area that UP&C shined was service.  Our server was funny  attentive and very knowledgeable about the food.  Without a doubt the best part of our meal.\\n\\nOverall  I thought that UP&C was OK  but really made me think that I overpaid for what was a just a \\\"\"\"\"pretty ok\\\"\"\"\" meal.  There wasn't anything that was particularly off putting  but there also wasn't anything particularly delightful either.  It just kinda... was.\"",

If you're complaining on the price  you're looking for a ribs joint in the ghetto  which this certainly isn't.  The price is high (sides are separate)  but not ludicrous.   The appetizers were spot-on; beans  cornbread  mac & cheese  coleslaw; these are all perfect.\\n\\n\\nBut the ribs and fried chicken we had were bad.  The most expensive things on our bill weren't good; the main courses weren't any good. \\n\\n\\n It took about twenty minutes for our food to come out  which is a bad sign at a BBQ joint; usually  the food is cooked for hours  but they should be able to serve it up quick at that point.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had half a fried chicken  and we debated sending it back when it hit the table.  It had been in the fryer waaaay too long  and the outside of everything was burned.  It looked burned and blackened. It tasted burned.  Ugh.\\n\\nIn my case  I had a rack of ribs.  It was undersmoked; they weren't slow-cooked all the way through.  To make up for that  it looked like they'd grilled the hell out of it for those twenty minutes  and burned all of the outside of the ribs.  Edible  but not delicious.\\n\\nThe wait staff we worked with seemed very new at this.  They were perfectly fine waitstaff for a ribs place  but to make it upscale - and sell $10+ drinks! - the wait staff needs a bit more practice and polish.\\n\\nHaving a coat rack or coat hook or some place to put a coat in winter was also a strangely missing touch.\\n\\n\\nOn the plus side  all of that is fixable  and I'll head back in six months to a year  but man  there are some bugs to work out here.",

Islays are the harsh peaty whiskeys) and your host pours you a small tasting glass. \\n\\nThe next step of the tour is the largest collection of whiskey in the world. It's an impressive collection and very well presented. I believe you can pay more to take the last tour of the day which allows you to spend more time in the collection room. I found it interesting  but didn't feel like I was missing out on anything by mainly looking at the collection as a whole  and not examining each individual bottle. \\n\\nFinally  the tour exits into the tasting room. If you paid for the \\\"\"\"\"silver tour\\\"\"\"\" you are now done. If you bought the \\\"\"\"\"gold tour\\\"\"\"\" you get a flight of whiskey from the tasting room. This flight is chosen by the museum and will generally consist of a lower-end whiskey from each of the four regions. Please do not ask the host to give you top-shelf 30 year malts instead. \\n\\nYou can also purchase glasses of whisky in the tasting room. I found if you sit at the bar and wait until the wave of people from the latest tour group have trickled out  the host will have time to talk to you and make some good recommendations based on what you've tried that you like. \\n\\nThe hosts were all very friendly and very knowledgeable.\\n\\nWhen you decide you're done there  you can go to the gift shop and buy whisky to take with you or any number of little tchochkes.\\n\\nI wouldn't say I learned a ton at the Scotch Whisky Experience  but I found the tour design to be fascinating (you can tell some serious money and thought went into it - even if it is hokey)  the large whisky collection to be impressive and getting recommendations from the hosts to be worthwhile. All in all an enjoyable way to spend part of an afternoon if you like whisky.\"",

Auto repair is one of those categories that you pretty much end up choosing between a bunch of places with 1-3 star reviews  and hoping for the best. So imagine my delight when we needed some work done shortly after moving to Charlotte and seeing a garage with ONLY 5 star reviews. Almost too good to be true  but it ended up being true for us. \\n\\nWe took out SUV to Neighborhood garage needing new brakes  and hoping to figure out what was causing a troublesome vibration coming from the engine. I met Andy when I dropped the car off after hours and was immediately impressed with the level of attention and genuine interest he gave to the description I gave him. He actually stopped the work he was doing and got a piece of paper and pen to take down notes about my situation. The problem ended up being a pretty tough nut to crack. Luckily I was able to leave my car with Andy long enough for him and his team (working late on my car several times) to figure it out. We were EXTREMELY relieved to learn that the problem was a tricky but inexpensive motor mount. Andy had it fixed the next day  and only charged for the part for that portion of the work. In other words  he and several of his employees worked for several hours on several different day trying to diagnose the issue  and didn't charge a dime for any of it.\\n\\nAndy is extremely friendly  very responsive  and engaged when dealing with you. I find myself keeping a list of little nuisance issues I have been putting off having fixed just to be able to give Andy our work. I really can't overstate how happy we are to have found such a great place to go to for the type of stuff we've always dreaded until now. \\n\\nAndy and Neighborhood Garage will have our business -- and anyone else who asks us -- for as long as we live in Charlotte.",

It's a Mughlai dish that features \\\"\"\"\"nine gems\\\"\"\"\"  a mix of nine vegetables and sometimes paneer cheese in a rich creamy sauce with some nuts and dried fruit. It's a rich dish  and I usually avoid it if there is another curry on the menu that doesn't feature cream  but  as I said  vegetables were scarce. The korma that arrived at our table wasn't a korma at all  but previously frozen vegetables (I can always tell...can't you?) in a sauce that had the color and flavor of a processed cheese sauce. Kind of like Kraft macaroni and cheese without the macaroni. This dish is an affront to the idea of korma  and laughably bad. \\n\\nWe fared a little better with the chicken chettinad  which was spicy and somewhat flavorful  although the chicken was served in a bowl that was too small for the contents  and it hadn't been cut into small enough pieces to eat without a knife.

Dark meat and had a nice crunchy crust and they even seasoned the chicken with a little salt. The rest of it was meh. Potato salad was halfway cooked containing bits of still raw potato hunks. Curry was Golden brand brick instant curry and is there a shortage of the stuff? When that nuclear reactor blew up did it take out the curry brick factory?

I have been going to the Chandler and Tempe locations for many  many years and was always more than willing to make the drive because I love it there. Until recently  I was frequenting the Ahwatukee location on average of 1 - 2 times a week to meet friends for lunch. However  the last four times (in a row!) that I have been there  the service was abhorrent  and the food sub-par. \\n\\nHere are some basic  common sense rules of thumb that the Ahwatukee Pita Jungle wait staff should learn to adhere to:\\n\\n1) When customers order appetizers  soup and an entree  a waiter/waitress is supposed bring the appetizer out first  then the soup  then the entree. They aren't supposed to bring it out all at once and crowd it onto the table allowing most of what you ordered to get cold. This happened the last three times I was there. \\n\\n2) It is absolutely disgusting when you see a waitress wiping down tables then  without washing their hands  turn around and pick your glass up by the freaking brim and refill your drink.

Order was from last night.\\nI'm pasting the comment that I sent to PJ on their website below:\\n\\nOrdered a pick up online. 2 mediterranean chicken pitas (1 no onion) and a kids meal. There were 3 issues with my order. My husband went to pick up the order and he was charged for a large soda. He was surprised by this because I don't buy us sodas  he even questioned the cashier and she said \\\"\"\"\"yes  there is a large soda on this order\\\"\"\"\". WRONG. No large soda was ordered  you all owe me $3.00. 2nd problem  both pitas had onion. Your onions are very strong and they upset my stomach. I picked all the onions out of my pita but could still taste them. Husband is complaining that his stomach hurts from his onions  not your fault  I told him \\\"\"\"\"I told you so\\\"\"\"\"... but in regards to my pita  fail. 3rd issue my kids meal fruit was put in the clamshell with 4 HOT items: steamed broccoli  chicken and mac-n-cheese. Who puts fruit in with hot food? When I opened the clamshell the fruit was on the mac-n-cheese and the fruit was \\\"\"\"\"sweaty\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\n3 negatives  my husband doesn't want to stop by the Awhatukee PJ but I am sure we will again. \\n\\nThe positive that I would like to share is that there was a good amount of food in the kids meal  my stinker really enjoyed it.\\n\\nI would like a response from either the PJ or corporate.

I was looking forward to some gelato even though it was a bit cold outside but sadly  out of the 5 flavors offered  none were to my liking. My favorite flavors are anything with chocolate or caramel but neither were offered. \\n\\nMy family immediately gravitated toward the cake display so I joined them. Two people purchased chocolate cupcakes  one a red velvet cupcake  another the pumpkin cheesecake and I got the coconut cake. The service at Bar Cocoa was great! The gentleman was friendly  smiling and very pleasant. At the bar they only offered coffee and hot chocolate. We were encouraged to grab a seat at the Ritz Carlton lounge area where we would be offered a wider selection of drinks.\\n\\nOur desserts were all just average tasting. No one  including myself  was wowed by anything. I usually love most coconut flavored anything but this cake was filled with big chunks of coconut flakes. I couldn't detect any actual cake in there at all. It was unpleasantly chewy. I don't recommend it.\\n\\nThe lounge in the Ritz was dimly lit with a beautiful stone fireplace toward the back where there is a second bar serving cocktails. The lounge area was fairly empty. There was one table occupied with a couple. My family and I sat down and were noticed by the female server as we walked in but she didn't approach our table. I found that odd but I waited. About 5 minutes later she went to the table with the couple and asked them if they wanted more drinks. She took their order  left  and promptly returned with their drinks. Then she left again without coming over to us. Another 5 minutes goes by and a second couple enters the lounge area with their desserts from Bar Cocoa. As as they're seated she approaches their table and asks if they want anything. Then she leaves again without even looking our way. At that point we were almost done and didn't want to stay any longer with such rude and dismissive service. \\n\\nI am not sure why she chose to ignore our table but I was extremely disappointed. I expected better from such an establishment. With mediocre desserts and horrible service I definitely won't be going back or bringing anymore guests with me when looking for a place to satisfy our sweet tooth.

The parking spaces on the North side had broken glass all over the place and with traffic behind me I had to drive through it. Not cool. Then after getting a space I can't even get to the door because the hordes of people are gawking at a Henderson PD Parking Enforcement officer who was circling like a vulture waiting to write tickets. Once inside I had a foot run over by a shopping cart and in the bulk foods section I had 2 different people ram me in the derriere with a cart in under 90 seconds. Hello? I'm 6'4 and wearing a red shirt. It's not like they couldn't see me! I know I'm not a small guy. But I'm trying to lose weight so having a steel shopping cart attached to my rear is not going to help me any. \\n\\nSo after extracting myself from the shopping carts of mayhem I head over to the deli counter. I ask them a simple question about the source of their meats and I get the classic I don't have a clue shrug. Ugh! After fighting the madhouse to get through the rest of the store for what I need I finally get up to the front to check out. I have 16 items...I thought it was 15  my bad. Self check out is for 15 items..it's posted on the overhead sign. I get in line and next thing I know I have some woman counting my items and saying I have 1 too many. Fine  I take an item out of the cart and set it to the side and she's like sorry  you have to go to another line. I tell her I now have 15 items  she's like you need to go to another line. At that point I'm at thermonuclear launch mode (this is ultra rare for me) and I'm like this is ridiculous. I raise my voice and tell her and a lot of others in earshot: Let me tell you how I'm going to save at WinCo...I'm leaving  and I WON'T BE BACK! On my way out the door a couple that saw what happened said good for me  that I did the right thing. Not that I needed the validation but still...enough is enough. \\n\\nMaybe when someone carves a replica of the Taj Mahal in ice in Hell  Michigan will I ever step foot in that store again. 1 star  and a bump to the EEK! I THINK NOT / Worst of Las Vegas list and an email to WinCo Corporate is my response. \\n\\nFor the sake of readability I've left out even more bad things that happened on this trip...don't even get me started on the bakery!

        "text": "The old bus depot on the corner of North Casino Center Boulevard and East Stewart Avenue turns into the Downtown 3rd Farmers Market every Friday. This is unlike your traditional farmers market of produce farmers and ranchers. You still get the initial sense of a farmers market atmosphere when you enter the front door. Beautiful fruits and vegetables dazzle the senses with vibrant colors and wonderful sweet and savory scents. I was surprised how many fruits and vegetables are able to grow in the Las Vegas heat from beautiful leafy greens like arugula to sexy red strawberries. But as you walk pass the produce  the market turns into an artisan's delight. \\n\\nLet's take a look at some of the vendors:  \\n \\nValley Best - Exceptional Dried Fruit: The fruits are dried but they keep a vibrant color. The fruits also do not have extra sugar added. Take a bite and let the fruit stay in your mouth. The flavor exudes and it's like you're eating a fresh piece of fruit. Our favorites were the Natural Tart Dried Apple  Dried Saskatoon Berries  and Dried Lemon Slices. A wonderful tip on the lemon slices - put a slice in with your diet cola and the lemon flavor lasts all day. We filled a glass 5 times during the day and the lemon flavor was just as refreshing and lemony. Can't wait to go back for more dried fruits!\\n\\nArizona Tamale Factory: Green Chile Beef  Mole Chicken  BBQ Pulled Pork  New Mexico Green Chile & Cheese  Marinated Artichoke & Black Olive. The tamales are made without lard so if you're not a fan of pork fat and would like to partake in her vegetarian options  you're good to go. Dessert tamales like Peanut Butter Cup that tastes like a brownie with melted chocolate and peanut butter in the middle. Delicioso! Rooster Hot Sauces ranging from mild to very hot.\\n\\nThe Juicery: They utilize fruits and vegetables from the farmers' market as well as their own supply of fresh fruits and vegetables from their local growers. Along with their juice menu  they now offer fresh smoothies as well. The Berry Deluxe was a wonderfully fresh delight - not overly sweet like the chain smoothie shops. \\n\\nGG's Gourmet specializes in vegan cuisine from organic gourmet cupcakes and granola to teas and savory items. Vegan cupcakes are masterpieces  looking exactly like a gourmet cupcake you would get at a bakery. These baked confections have no dairy - no milk  butter  nor cream  but taste so creamy and dreamy  you can't stop eating them. The cake itself was fluffy  not too dense  and moist. The frosting was like the best butter cream you have ever tasted. The Chocolate Cupcake with Peanut Butter Frosting was my favorite! They also has a line of savory items like sandwiches and salads. The quinoa salad was refreshing and great on a hot day. Everything is fabulous! \\n\\nEverybody Must Get Scones (part of Chef on the Run) serves freshly baked scones  cookies  brownies  tea breads and specialty cakes. A sampling of cold  summer salads like Orzo Salad  Couscous Salad  and my favorite  Edamame Bean Salad.  Usually cold bean salads are loaded with vinegar  but not Donna's  it's fresh  vibrant  and accentuates the flavors of the edamame  garbanzo  and kidney beans. I'm not a big scone fan  but their recipe has me hooked on them now. Before  I have found that scones are always dry and pasty  but their recipe is just the opposite. The scone had the consistency of a buttermilk drop biscuit  fluffy and tender. The scones are sweetened like a biscuit with butter and honey. The mixed fruit scones were fabulous chalked full of dried cranberries  blueberries  and raisins. These were great with a caf\\u00e9 au lait the next morning.",

Secondly  the place is cramped as hell and there is really only room for one-way traffic  but of course it goes both directions. The people selling stuff aren't friendly at all (some were texting  others were eating chips) and the samples that were laid out were wilting in the heat and I wouldn't recommend anybody risk their health with those gnarly samples. The produce was a joke  but that is what i expected in Las Vegas  not really a farming headquarters. $5 a scone  $6 for a loaf a bread you can fiind at Trader Joes  some juice place reusing the same blender for everyone's drinks. The only thing I tried was the Arizona tamale place which was way in the corner devoid of people and this was another ripff. I don't care if your tamale is organic  it shouldn't be 5 bucks  unless your hawking them at the Bellagio  not in the homeless shlter downtown. Organic tamales are nasty anyway  made by an old white couple. The only tamales I need to be purchasing are from the Mexican folks. The chicken and green chile was tasteless and just a few weeks ago  I had an incredible $2 green chile/cheese tamale in Santa Fe. The fun part is peeling the husk off  but these people do it for you - bad karma. It's a hot  sweaty mess overpriced inside that bus terminal and whoever reviews it otherwise must be nuts. Oh and all kinds of garbage  bums and discarded clothing really liven up the outside of the terminal. Loserville.",

Even so  from what I've heard and read...this isn't the place to go for a Mongolian grill experience. I've been here a handful of times and it just seems to get worse every single time.\\n\\nFor the most part everyone who's been here or somewhere similar  you know how it works. But I was here this past weekend and watched 4 different tables get seated without anyone asking if they'd been there before or know what to do. Customers just stand there confused until someone comes back and for the restaurant  that's ridiculous. Sure  it's not hard to figure out but if you've never been anywhere like it  I imagine that's a frustrating experience. I hate their customer service for many other reasons so maybe my opinion is a little biased  but they definitely need to train the employees better. They don't explain anything to anyone  including the fact they you need to go get your own drink. \\n\\nWhen it comes to the food  it's fun being able to pick your own stuff and make your own creations but like others have mentioned  they are always out of stuff. Then when it's busy and only one line is open  the whole entire experience just goes out the window because it feels so rushed. Also  I'm not sure if it's a health reason or what...but why is all the stuff so far away from the counter? I have to bend down and reach under that tiny area to get to items in the back. It's all just very annoying to me. The food is okay but I think they overcook everything  again  maybe for health reasons? The meats themselves always seem to be dry and chewy. If you get egg  it's almost like a fried egg that someone forgot to pull off the stove. There's just nothing spectacular.\\n\\nI think it'll be a while before I go back. The service is crap  the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. For 3 adults and kid to eat  it cost about $50 without the \\\"\"\"\"all you can eat\\\"\"\"\".

If you don't like the finished product  well  it's your own fault. It's a matter of trial and error. I've been here 6 times so I know which meats and veggies I like and which seasonings and sauces--there are lots of choices  some spicy  some not  but for me  less is better. I like the teriyaki sauce and the honey soy with a little salt  garlic  and ginger. The important tip is to fill your initial bowl to overflowing because it will cook down. I find the small bowl is enough for me  but they have a medium and a large. You also get to choose what to put you meats and veggies over--white  brown  or fried rice  udon noodles  pasta  tortilla  or cabbage.

In conclusion  I feel my experience here wasn't anything that wow-ed me  to be honest. I heard about this place when it opened  but steered clear for the entire time because I heard horror stories about how atrocious the waits and lines were.\\n\\nI came here last Sunday for lunch around 11 something and there was a line that snaked outside the door  ending just outside of the shaded covering. The wait continued inside to the registers and I would say in total...the wait was about 45 mins or so.\\n\\nI had heard raves about how Golden Corral was comparable to a Vegas buffet and how it kicked Hometown Buffet's ass  etc  etc. And I felt that with the crazy lines this place had brought out when it first opened (and still  even a few months in with its opening)  that this place had to have some sort of majestic charm.\\n\\nTo be honest though  I felt the fare offered here was alright. Definitely not on the level of a \\\"\"\"\"Vegas buffet\\\"\"\"\" as I had heard early on (although there are small things here and there to note). The interior design faintly mimics those of Paris Buffet and maybe even The Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood (you know  with the faux windows  awnings  and separate stations/buildings)  but that's probably about it in terms of appearance. Now granted  the food wasn't bad or anything (there are even some small things that make Golden Corral better than Hometown  such as the corn here  which is plump and juicy) - overall the food is by far better than the quality Hometown Buffet serves up  but it's nothing that'll blow you away. However  I do like that there are some special things here  such as the machine cotton candy and coconut macaroons  and also the steaks  which are cooked right in front of you by a team of chefs - all these small things bring that higher-end feel (or \\\"\"\"\"Vegas feel\\\"\"\"\") to Golden Corral.\\n\\nIt's hard to say whether I'll be coming back or not. I used to love buffets so much when I was a kid  but I think growing up  I've come to be quite indifferent about them. Even with this review  I feel like something's missing - I'm not disappointed  but I'm not too impressed either.  I just don't know. I guess I'm just not the kind of person who'll want to wait in a long line for food anymore. Again  nothing particularly bad about this place  but again - nothing particularly special.\"",

With a couple of drinks  just be prepared to spend over $100/pp because even just a bottle of water (imported from Wales) will cost you $8. But  hey it's Vegas. We'll probably go back only for special occasions.",

The music was very hip and the \\\"\"\"\"channel tunnel\\\"\"\"\" look was a nice touch however I was not sure about the serving station which was sandwiched in amongst the rows of tables. I do not come to a restaurant so see my server cleaning plates and assembling knives. \\n\\nAnyway I had the onion soup as an appetizer. It was excellent however he bread was served by someone who could barely speak English. I am certainly not a xenophobe however there were some almost dangerous consequences as I did not understand the explanation that there was mushroom in the bread (which would have caused some serious health issues had I not caught it). Furthermore its just frustrating not being able to understand what has been presented in front of you.\\n\\nAnyway my biggest issue tonight was the steak. I ordered a ribeye. This is a fatty steak. I know this  however almost half my steak was gristle. It was a joke. What was worse I showed my server the plate half full of fat and he argued with me and basically told me I should have ordered another steak. I did not pay $300 on a meal for two for some snooty waiter to lecture me on the finer points of a cow. I got a bad cut of meat and rather than apologize the waiter turned it around and made it my problem.\\n\\nWe ordered sticky toffee pudding and it was excellent. A must if you go to this place.\\n\\nOverall this place was ok but at $300 on a meal for two I expect it to perfect which it was not.\"",

When I was planning my October vacation I specifically chose Vegas just so that I could have dinner here! To say that it was a let down is a huge understatement. \\n\\nWhen we arrived I was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant. It's beautiful! We sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs. I should note that I made reservations several months in advance. They really do fill up  so know that planning well in advance is necessary here. \\n\\nI knew it would be a long relaxing dinner. I was excited for the whole experience. This was just slow though. We sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approached us. I was dying of thirst! Don't get me wrong  our server was wonderful. I just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours. I was falling asleep at the table. \\n\\nThe presentation of the steaks is really cool. I've never seen anything like it. My mind was made up months ago though. I knew I was getting his signature beef wellington. It would be a decision I would live to regret. \\n\\nI started with the onion soup. It was really good  but not hot! I got the feeling it was not served to me right away. It was almost as cool as room temperature. My friends soups/salads were served perfectly though. The salads looked to be the way to go. \\n\\nThe beef wellington was awful! I ate about 25% of it and then threw in the towel. I guess I'm just not a fan of the baked meat? It was tender but I just couldn't get over the off taste of it. It literally tasted like I came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven. The pastry fell apart and didn't stay on the meat. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be though. I just sat there wishing I had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead. \\n\\nWe did a side of saut\\u00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts. Both were good. Those are hard to screw up though. I do regret not trying the Mac and cheese. That sounded good. \\n\\nI had been looking forward to dessert here for months! Timing was an issue on this one though. By the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed! No joke. I couldn't keep my eyes open. We had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back  but threw in the towel and went to bed. \\n\\nIn the end I received over a $400 bill for a dinner I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities. At least I have that memory. I won't be making the mistake of ever going back.",

We put our order in about 40 minutes before arriving at the restaurant. My fella called in and had the store on speaker while he ordered so I heard both sides of the conversation. He ordered the chicken and told them we would be by in about 30-40 minutes to pick up our order and that we had a Groupon to redeem. The girl on the phone kept saying \\\"\"\"\"ok  ok\\\"\"\"\" and even took down my fella's name  never once indicating they might have a problem having our order ready when we get there. \\n\\n40 minutes later  we arrive at Flavor Flav's and tell the guy at the counter that we put in a phone order and that we had a Groupon. The guy then referred us to the girl behind the counter who I assume is the one who took our phone order. She explained that they have had problems with people ordering over the phone in the past with a Groupon and showing up and not actually having a Groupon to redeem that they refuse to start cooking orders for customers with Groupons until customers show up. I can understand this as a problem  but I don't really understand why she couldn't have explained any of this to us over the phone when we put our order in. There were several other customers who had this precise problem that walked in after us and they were quite peeved as well. We put in our order at the counter and 45 frustrating minutes later we received our chicken and waffles (minus the red velvet  since they were out of batter). By this time  my fella was quite thirsty and asked for something to drink. They offered us a free two liter for our trouble and to be fair the staff was quite friendly to all that were waiting for their chicken  giving us updates as to how much longer we would have to wait and offering us beverages while we stood around. They could avoid all hostility with customers if they just explained their stance on phone orders in advance instead of having people come all the way in only to find out they have to order again in person and wait.\\n\\nThe food was really good  probably 4 stars if I was rating the food alone.

The lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche bread  not a roll  which just doesn't taste right and is horrible.  The lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery  to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.  The bread is coated with butter and pan fried which produces an oily  sloppy mess.  It's a failure sandwich of disappointment.\\n\\nAlso tried the lobster chowder in the bread bowl  which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.  My friend ordered the shrimp po boy  which was bad as well.  The shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not good at all.  Why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the bread roll I'll never know (we did ask  the chef refused).  \\n\\nThe sandwiches come with fries or coleslaw and you can \\\"\"\"\"combo\\\"\"\"\" it for $6 which means add a drink. WTH?  If it comes with fries anyway aren't you just paying $6 for a drink then?  Better strategy would be to go to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.  I ordered a coleslaw because my friend went with fries and got fries anyway.  After the 20 min wait for the food I didn't want to go back and exchange.\\n\\nBottom line: walk across the street to Planet Hollywood's LobsterMe instead for good lobster roll.\"",

Every time I get into the process I am grateful to live in a place on earth where a person or people accused of violating The State's rules of Civil behavior can be judged guilty or innocent by a group of people  guided by a Judge; not by a king  duke or prince  a dictator  angry mob  or a general who might bill my family for the bullet.  \\n\\nJury duty is a place We the People can feel and see our system of governance working.   A way of sitting in on the creation of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.  So's voting.  You can be sure you register to vote here too.  \\n\\nThat's the shining ideal.  I respect and love it.  We know when the idea is exercised shining ideals get tarnished.  That's the nature of humans  power and justice at this point in history.  Generally speaking  the legal system of this nation works.  Over recent past decades its begun working better for every American.  '\\n\\nFor me the juror  the most amazing thing about the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County is the new building.  During past calls to jury duty  I've sat hours in dingey brown rooms with uncomfortable  worn out  or both seating.  When you arrive for jury duty here it is state of the art in a well designed setting.  You're checked in through a computer kiosk  issued a badge via printer and can walk to either a large break or group seating area.\\n\\nThe break room's got a few tables set up for laptop or tablet workstations.  There's a coffee service and small cinnamon rolls.  There are several large flat panels throughout the area with some kind of media playing.   \\n\\nThe main waiting hall has comfy seating  and again  a medley of monitors.  These monitors have different content.  They run a series of informational programs explaining the judicial system  the individual's role as a juror  and display information for people called to various jury panels.  Another video details Arizona's exemplary system of selecting judges and assuring they are fit for duty.  If you choose  you can watch them before you come in for jury duty.  They play from the Jury Services Home Page.   \\n\\nJury duty may seem like a pain.  But if you're going to be part of the legal process and called to duty  there's no better place to serve in the 21st century than at the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County.    \\n\\nI expect there may be flames from this post....\"",

I've been on the phone over two hours with them today  and their final response was \\\"\"\"\"Well  if you still want our service  you're going to have to wait a few weeks.\\\"\"\"\"  Several reviewers had the same experience of if you raise a fuss  they just cancel your contract.

Also his paws were completely messed up. I have included pictures. And also I got a full groom  which meant a bath included.

You can never have enough of them. The macaroons usually come in three flavors daily  and they change the flavors sometimes. But no matter what flavor  it's always an enjoyment to have. Other bakeries can be overly sweet  but Sugar Bee's is right on the mark. It's not too sweet that you'll stop eating after a few bites.

Yesterday \\nI ordered a spicy soup and it smelt like shin ramyon soup. Seeing you didn't deny the usage of ramen soup  probably you are using it? Even if you didn't intentionally use MSG  using flavored salt (Mat-so-geum) or ramen soup means the served soup should contain MSG. I remember the server saying you use special sauce for spicy taste. I don't know what kind of sauce you are using  but I am pretty sure it contains MSG or equivalent artificial flavor. \\n\\nI didn't even mention your pork bulgogi that also tasted like MSG or beef dashida. Please check the sauces you are using before claiming your dishes are free of MSG.\\n\\n----------------------\\n  Shawn A. 6 hours ago \\nfirst  there is no way you can buy ramen soup only from markets and even if we used shinramen soup it does not contains MSG so your guess is wrong again.I We are tofu house and I studied and researched a long time to find what our  fofu soup takes to be loved by people and people love our soup and bbq these days. They wait in line to have our food. You don't want to say they are wrong about our food.\\n\\nI advise you not to eat out if you worry so much about MSG because even a hamburger  taco burrito  fried chicken  pho  Thai  steaks  American BBQ ...many more use the ingredients have a bit of mono sodium but FDA says still it is NO harm to people.\\n\\nLastly I would like to say you in a nice way NOT to criticize easily. We put a hundres of hours   effort  money  and love to our restaurant to make a living with our  love ones.\\nThe comment like yours hurts us so much.\\n\\nThanks\\n----------------------",

It hasn't been that busy each time I've came here so it's not too bad. The staff is very friendly and don't really constantly check up on you. I however  kind of need someone to check up frequently because I tend to drink a lot of water and rather fast too (maybe I'll ask them to leave the pitcher next time). \\n\\nCame here a few times to eat  the tofu soups are about $8.95 each and the combos I believe are around $15 (I haven't gotten any of them yet). The tofu soup along with the appetizers fill me up every time so I'm afraid to try something bigger unless I end up sharing with someone. They have some variety in their menu  but I come mainly for the tofu soup. \\n\\nI've tried the beef tofu soup  ham and sausage (would not recommend this one  because it's slices of ham and hot dogs)  and dumpling ones so far. There's a lot of meat in each of them which is good  but I would rather have more soup since I don't eat a lot of meat. I fill up rather fast with the soups + rice and then the appetizers and generally have leftovers too. I tried the tofu soups each time as spicy and to me they're not spicy at all (though extremely hot). \\n\\nI definitely like coming here and then over to Perfect scoop for dessert if I have room (I usually don't  but I'll do take out for the ice cream).",

Because A LOT of people in my age range loved the old cheers. So you're already fighting a uphill battle. We all love the area and are sad to see so many bars go with the tide in this economy  we just want a great place  that's DIFFERENT from the rest to park our buts on the weekends and take out minds off of whatever. \\n\\nI wont be coming back unless it's the last choice on my list of places.",

I used to come here a lot when my co-workers signed up for a juicing cleanse package they offered.\\n\\nThis is why I don't understand their prices. If you aren't buying organic and non-GMO  why are your prices so high? I could go to Whole Foods and get a custom juice for the same price that IS organic and non-GMO. I'm not going to get into a cost vs health debate here  but I bring this up because I was also told someone that worked here that organic and non-GMO weren't essential to a juice cleanse.

Sometimes you just really don't want a place where anybody knows your name. Sometimes you want to be a girl  alone at a bar  drinking a bourbon and reading a book. And Industry fits the bill perfectly. It's a good-looking place with a giant bar area and plenty of table seating -- but who cares about that when you want to eat alone? It's not too dark  there are lots of TVs  the music is a mystifying mix of Vampire Weekend  Beyonce and 80s  the servers range from charmingly social to semi-efficiently disinterested (which I'm ok with)  the food is decent -- I like the salads and the flatbreads but have heard mixed things about everything else -- and the drinks are interesting. Basically  it's the perfect combination of safe and anonymous  with the added benefit of a competent kitchen. \\n\\nThe cocktails tend to be on the sweet side and for some reason the person who designed the menu decided to name both a drink and a salad the Menlo Park  which makes for some confusion and seems like a ridiculous oversight. \\n\\nPricing is reasonable: many menu items are under $10.00. The cocktails are also reasonable but  given the sweetness  not really worth it. Or maybe they are. It depends what you like.\\n\\nBasically  this is a place I go by myself.

I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into  as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables  like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.

Over the years  my palette has gone from KFC to Popeyes  and now to local joints doing their own version of fried chicken. But one thing has always \\\"\"\"\"perked\\\"\"\"\" up my long forgotten feelings for the Colonel. That thing would be... the Double Down.\\n\\nI first saw the Double Down on TV a couple of years ago. After the initial backlash from the media and other groups  I thought that it would follow in the footsteps of the Arch Deluxe. To my surprise  I recently saw a commercial saying that they have brought back the Double Down. This time  I would not let opportunity to slip through my fingers.\\n\\nThis location is actually pretty nice. It's clean and well taken care of. Even though the hours say it closes at 10pm  the drive thru is open to 11. I came here at around 10:30 and the manager who took my order was very kind and helpful. What is great to know is that since it gets slower at night  they usually cook the food when the order comes in  so that they won't waste throwing away a lot of food at the end of the night. That also means that you will have fresh chicken straight out of the fryer  and not ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp for the past hour.\\n\\nDouble Down - Two pieces of breaded chicken that are fried until crispy. These are essentially the \\\"\"\"\"buns\\\"\"\"\". In the middle of these buns are bacon  melted cheese  and the KFC secret sauce that taste very similar to ranch. I gotta say  this is probably my favorite sandwich of all time. I wish every sandwich could be like this. Fried chicken  bacon  cheese  and sauce in sandwich form. It's brilliant. I probably want to give the person who invented this a Hi-5. No  I should say  2 Hi-fives!!! Maybe 3 but I don't want to be too greedy. Even though it's ok because I like the sandwich so much.\\n\\nCouldn't give the place 5 stars because I don't believe in factory farmed chicken. I'm sure the sandwich I ate was loaded with hormones and antibiotics. But  a great sandwich nonetheless. KFC  you slay me.\"",

You can do a very traditional curry with just sauce and potato  but you can go all the way up to having spam and/or shrimp gyoza on your curry. The serving sizes are generous for the price  and can be shared if you and your partner are not particularly hungry  but not excessive. The dishes are cohesive  mildly sweet  and satisfying  like Japanese-style curry sauces and dishes should be. The green tea desserts are made with great matcha. Bullet-proof deliciousness there. Definitely trying the chantilly dessert next time.\\n\\nI love the attention to detail the staff has as well  providing extra spoons when they know you'll be sharing  and remembering people from past visits.

I found RePetes on line & the reviews made me willing to make the 30 min round trip to get food from there. I ordered my boyfriend a breakfast burrito  which on the menu there was NO mention of it including onions which my boyfriend is allergic to. When I got home my boyfriend opened his burrito to find it FILLED with onions. I called RePetes & spoke with Josh  who has originally taken my order. He apologized profusely & offered to remake it for free if I came back. I was so tired I didn't want to waste another 30 minutes driving around  so I asked for a refund that I would come in for later. Josh said he'd have to get the refund approved by his manager & if for any reason it wasn't approved  he said he would refund me out of his own tips. A few days later I went back in  ordering another breakfast burrito  assuming that it would be comped. When I arrived Josh recognized me right away. He started to tell me that he asked the chef & he said he never put onions in my burrito & they don't even come on it.... Basically like I'm an idiot & don't know what an onion looks/smells like  and he argued with me for about 5 minutes over whether or not the onions were actually in there or not! Then he tells me \\\"\"\"\"the chefs human to  we all make mistakes\\\"\"\"\" Really!?!? & then when I asked if I could get the burrito comped  he tells me he can't because he wasn't the one who took my order. But to make up for it he offered my underaged friend and I shots to make up for it. Needless to say I won't be returning to RePetes.\"",

I wake up  ready to start my day and go get my hair done  grab lunch with my girlfriend and then party the night away.  And then I discover the pool that is my garage.\\nApparently  my water heater decided to die sometime in the middle of the night and drain the contents of it's body all over the floor.  RIP Heaty.  It's nine in the morning on new year's eve  and I'm panic stricken  trying to find a plumber to come out and either fix or replace it.  Thank gosh for Yelp and Water Heater Pros.\\n\\nI gave them a call and left a voicemail  and promptly got called back within ten or so minutes.  They asked me basic questions about my unit  assessed that it needed to be replaced and quoted me a price.  A great price in my opinion  given that the first company I had talked to wanted $300 more for the exact same thing.  He gave me a time of between 11:30-12:30  which was even better.  Same day service on a (almost) holiday?  Then to top it off  there was a knock at my door about 15 minutes before the time window - yay!  Not just on time  but early.\\n\\nI got to have Charlie work on my heater.  He confirmed it needed replacing  and after we talked briefly about the heater and what all needed to be done  I let him alone to work in peace.  Within about ninety minutes  he was all wrapped up and I still have time to make my hair appointment today.  \\n\\nI am amazingly pleased all around.  With Charlie's nice demeanor  his service  showing up early  and the pricing.  I'll definitely recommend Water Heating Pros to any friends that might get in a similar situation in the future.",

        "text": "\"My husband and I wanted to try something new for date night and I've known about Bachi Burger for years through Yelp as \\\"\"\"\"one of the best burgers in Las Vegas\\\"\"\"\" as well as all of my friends constantly obsessing over it. We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet  but still so addicting. \\n\\nWe then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite  I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top  but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot  like it was made fresh. There wasn't much oxtail that I could taste and the warmth issue was very off putting. Lastly  we settled for the Miyagi San burger and Ronin burger. I LOVE fusion food  but I was not impressed by the flavors of the Ronin. Something was just missing to make it amazing. I did appreciate the crunch of the coleslaw and the caramelized onions  but all the other flavors cancelled out the taste of the fried egg. My husband's Miyagi burger was much better  but we asked for it medium and it was WELL done. There was no pink or anything  but the taste of the fried egg was amazing and the onion strips were crispy and fried to perfection. Overall  I would say that Holsteins has better burgers for this price range  and to not believe the DDD and Yelp hype. Come try it for yourself  but I don't think I'll be back.\"",

I have been several times and usually have good service  however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian  prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion  there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait  so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian  both saw us and continued working  one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is \\\"\"\"\"How are you planning to pay?\\\"\"\"\" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money  we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded  \\\"\"\"\"i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments.\\\"\"\"\" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu) . After we go that worked out  she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders  requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order  unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier  i placed my order over the phone as a to go order  that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there  i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective. Overall I think they could improve their customer service  especially for seating. I typically wait about 5 minutes and every time i have gone it has always been between 2% and 25% full.\"",

I was game  especially because this was one of our little out of town get away foodie adventures. There were 3 of us.  We ordered the chili cheese fries with ox tail.  That was bomb.  The flavors were all so robust!! The flavors could easily all stand on their own  but as a combination  together  all in one bite  WOWZAS!!  I really enjoyed them.  We each ordered different burgers. \\n\\nWe ordered these burgers:\\nShogun Burger\\nMiyagi Burger\\nKiki Burger\\n\\nThe shogun  best ordered deconstructed  was beautiful.  That slice of white peach as amazing.  The color was beuatiful.  It was just ripe enough. The citrus transformed the flavor of the uni  it was amazing.  The wagyu beef was so tender and was really cooked to perfection.  The brioche bun made it great as well.\\n\\nThe miyagi burger was great.  It was a bit too much for me to eat  especially after we'd just devoured the fries  but the flavors were also fantastic.  The meat  again  was to die for.  The flavors were full  hearty and so perfectly balanced with the furikake  the bacon  the onions and the mayo.  \\n\\nThe Kiki was packed full of mushrooms.  I really loved the onion marmalade that they had on there  accompanied by that fantastic gruyere and garcil chili aioli.  If you love mushrooms  this is definitely the burger for you!! \\n\\nThe momotaro  white peach strawberry soda  is so yummy!! It's not every day that you can find a place that makes something like this  and makes it well.  I'd definitely suggest that you try it. Yes  it's non-alcoholic. So  it's great to share with your little one as a treat. But sorry  there are no refills. DARN IT!!! \\n\\nI'd love to eat here again.  In fact  I think I'll bring my husband next month.  Yum!!

She doesn't even talk to me or ask me a single thing about how it's normally done. (Based on her technique  she has never done a pixie) I look in the mirror at the end as she asks how I style it. I tell her how I style  she styles it into some sort of bangs and I scrape it back out of the bangs into a traditional side swept pixie style. Whatever. I'll fix it at home. I pay and I leave. \\n\\nI get to the car. The sides seem a bit odd and poufy. As I stop at lights  I look at it. The sides by my ears were barely even trimmed. I have no idea if this was her first ever short cut  but holy hell is it bad! I came straight home to fix it with my own texturizing razor. My husband had to fix the back of my neck because she left it all fuzzy. Seriously  if you want anything more than a trim  perhaps  look elsewhere. Awful.\"",

My husband on the other hand loves that German sausage  so to make him happy I put my dislike for brats aside and went in with an open mind. Lucky for him I was starving  and my pregnant belly was aching for anything at this point. So Friday night we mosey on over after he read some of the reviews on yelp. He ordered himself a bratwurst on a roll with some spicy mustard a side of French fries and the owner who is straight out of Germany provided some curry dipping sauce on the side. I ordered a cheeseburger combo that came with a nice amount of French fries and a medium sized soft drink for 6.95. My cheeseburger was juicy and very flavorful. It was soaked in condiments nor was it falling apart  it was pretty darn delish! Now my husbands bratwurst was served on what looked like the perfect kaiser roll  it was flaky on the outside and yet soft to the bite....the aroma coming off of that bratwurst was so enticing I had to have a bite  it was AMAZING. WOW! Now I could never eat a bratwurst sandwich all on my own  but a couple of bites of that sandwich was pretty much like a little taste of heaven. The homemade curry will leave you craving it  it's the perfect blend of spices  incredibly tasty. The place is very clean  and the owner is very nice. If your in the area I would definitely recommend stopping in and grabbing a bite!",

        "text": "\"A solid two stars  yes!\\n\\nFirst of all  I'll say the taste of the food is pretty good.  The quality of the food and drink was above average.  The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices  but came in a rather small tin.  We began with two cocktails which were delicious  but for the area  were either too small  or overpriced.  Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.\\n\\nWe did not have appetizers because in my mind  they were a little pricey.  Deviled eggs for $1.00 each?  Ok  I get it  these are local eggs.  But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00?  Nope  still expensive.  Fries for $4.00?  Nope  not for this guy.  Besides  Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests.  $9.00 for a mixed greens salad?  How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?\\n\\nMoving on  I wanted to try the famous \\\"\"\"\"Tavern Burger.\\\"\"\"\"  However  at 7:45 p.m.  in a restaurant which wasn't packed out  they were out for the evening.  Really?  Hmmm  how strange.  You mean the cheapest choice for dinner  the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty  and  worth mentioning again  your CHEAPEST dinner choice  was out so early?  How very strange...  I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And  incidentally  our server told us you made it fresh every day.  So  why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix?  Or  does the bison truck come very morning?)\\n\\nWe chose the Trout and the Pork Loin.  First  the portion sizes were tiny.  For the price of the trout  we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00.  What we got was about 1/3 to  1/2 of a side of a small trout.   As for the pork  we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion.  Now  I understand it's local.  But  and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook  pork is not expensive.  There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef.   And  the accompaniments  the turnips  chicory and cornbread were nice  tasty and well presented  were cool and not substantial.  The pork  for the price  should have been at least twice the size  and even this would have made the price extravagant.\\n\\nWe shared a bottle of white wine from the menu  the wine selection being very good by the way  and also had dessert.  I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard)  and my guest had the Pot de Cr\\u00e8me.  Both were delicious!\\n\\nOverall  I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00.  Can you believe it?  $140.00 for two cocktails  one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00  two main dishes and two desserts.   Fine for Haute Cuisine  not fine for a tavern.\\n \\nWe found the service to be just about perfect  as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is great in this place.  The food is good  but not great.  With the expanding options in the area  especially the great options across the street  there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.\"",

The decor was super cute and impeccably clean. The girl behind the counter helping me was friendly and informative and took great care in helping me. The cupcakes look very cute and I was excited to try as many different ones I could for a kids birthday party. She told me it would be no problem to eat these the next day  as they are good three days out no problem.  She told me to wrap them in cling wrap to keep them moist. Additionally  I put them in our wine cellar as it's humid in there and I wanted them to be moist. I got a vanilla and a chocolate gluten free cupcake for myself and a variety of non-gluten free ones for the kids.  I tried a little of each of the gluten free cupcakes and was HORRIFIED by how AWFUL these things both tasted. Both were hard like rocks. Very very dense cupcakes. The chocolate had a weird flavor in it  I think coconut. The vanilla tasted like they put a shot of flavoring in them and was very overpowering. I couldn't eat either of these. One of my daughters got the cookie dough cupcake and the other got the chocolate. It's rare for my kids not to want to finish anything with sugar in them and both kids took a bite and didn't want anymore of their cupcakes.

We were having a great time when we were asked by a waitress with blond hair right before our meals were to be delivered if she could move our table down. Without explaining the true intentions she started separating our tables. We were sitting at two  two tops  the four of us. At first we didn't ask why but soon after were told that the intention was to put the four of us around a single two top and that this was policy. You're were not even at full capacity! So I said no. After we got our meals  without our coleslaws  the service of your staff became distant and we received looks from the blond that were not complimentary.\\nOn leaving is when we confronted her with our dissatisfaction  one in our party could not even eat his meal and asked for it to go. I have been in the restaurant business for 30 years  and for all the reasons we came back as customers to the new Pour House  is now why we will not return. Our business is a word of mouth business  and I plan to retract my support with many that I have previously made \\\"\"\"\"glowing\\\"\"\"\" recommendations to.\\nI guess now that your business is thriving again under your ownership that you can afford to run business off with the practice of trying to use every chair possible  and making your customers uncomfortable.

First of all  they were charging $10 a head to get in  which I'm sure a portion goes to support the artists  but still. Once inside  the drink prices are way too high. If I remember correctly  a 12oz bottle of Bud Light was $6  and a teeny tiny shot of Fireball was $9. Sorry  but you don't get to charge Vegas prices at a dilapidated building in Phoenix. The lower level is OK I guess  and it worked to set up the runway and jewelry stands and stuff. The patio was nice. I could have done without the vendor making frybread  resulting in everyone smelling heavily like fried food  but the heaters they had set up did make it a little more comfortable. \\nThe restroom situation was appalling. They had a BATHROOM ATTENDANT  and half the toilet stalls were either missing a toilet SEAT  or a stall lock  or something. How can they charge so much for drinks and cover  and not be able to take care of very basic maintenance like this? And then expect me to pay someone to wash my hands?\\nThe upper level was cool  once I found it and got up there. I liked the additional bar upstairs. The floor in the hall to the stairwell was missing tiles and was very uneven which they decided to just cover with a rug. Pretty dangerous  especially when you have women wearing heels.

It looked good I thought but when I unwrapped it the fish was unpleasant smelling and felt slimy so I returned it the next day. \\n\\nToday I saw them loading up the fish counter with Lots Of Sockeye Salmon. This time I thought some of the fish didn't look fresh and the PLACE STUNK AND SMELLED JUST LIKE LEE LEE's.\\n\\nThen I went to check out and I didn't feel like waiting a half hour as the two lines open had families with multiple carts filled all the way up so I did the self check out and that was fine.\\n\\nThe wheels on my cart locked two aisles before the yellow line. So I had to drag my cart out from in front of someone's car. Grab my bags and the one bag falls apart on me and my stuff falls to the ground. A guy in the lot told me those carts do get out of sync sometimes.\\n\\nSo BRING YOUR OWN BAGS!\\n\\nThe Fish MIGHT be spoiled!\\n\\nBe Prepared for your cart to suddenly lock it wheels before you get to your car.",

Our server was definitely not friendly to start... Passion fruit mojitos were super weak  pretty much ice water ...some of our dishes took 45 mins to the table.... Way longer than it should have  even for tapas. Best thing we ordered were the sliders... Empanadas were good as well. I would seriously advise against the baked cod.. Way over seasoned with chili flakes  perhaps to hide the unfreshness of the fish  yucky. Over all it wasn't worth the $75 spent...and we won't be back.",

For these reasons I really wanted to like Take Five. I really did. I've even given it 4-5 tries. Each time I go hoping that maybe they finally got their stuff together.  Then I leave with the sad realization that they still have a lot of work to do if they want to compete with the rest of Willy St.\\n\\nYou know how sometimes upon entering a restaurant you can just smell the desperation? This is one if those places.  On my last visit we walked in and noticed they had done some rearranging.  Unfortunately it looked and felt  like it was furnished with used dorm room housewares from Target. The only other person at the bar was the cook. And to top it off there was a techno remix of The Price Is Right Theme song playing on the lone speaker behind the bar.  Needless to say this set our expectations pretty low.\\n\\nWe cautiously approached the bar and ordered the evening specials- $2 tacos and $3 margaritas. The margaritas were pretty syrupy and sugary. I wouldn't order them again. The tacos were ok. We each ordered the same 3 tacos- 1 chicken 1 lamb and 1 pork. They were luke warm which is odd because we were the only people in the restaurant. They were served on the smallest corn tortillas I've ever seen and I've seen my fair share of tacos. The flavor was ok. I guess I'd say the pork taco was the better of the 3.  But none were anything special.\\n\\nI won't be going back.  There are too many other better options on Willy St.",

        "text": "\"Meh. I've experienced better.\\n\\nGood and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that  I still decided to go more than once.\\n\\nFirst go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was  \\\"\"\"\"meh.\\\"\"\"\"  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor  but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen  but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.\\n\\nSecond go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record  their adobada won this battle.  Really  in my experience  I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey  but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though  but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\\n\\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots  onions  and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention  and truth be told  I almost missed out.  On my first visit  someone  noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu  deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\\n\\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best  and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way  it's all pretty decent.\"",

If the overall Yelp rating isn't enough for you  and the Elite endorsements aren't either - keep on reading. But just so you know  you could save yourself the reading time and make a reservation now.\\n\\nMost sushi in Vegas is all-you-can-eat. Kabuto is the exact opposite of the very notion of food-to-money value. This is an experience. This is one of the rare places in the city that can bring you close to experiencing the taste and expertise of Japan. You're going to pay up to $120 for a designed and manicured experience  not including your drinks and extras. Be ready to see through the lens of the prideful sushi chef.\\n\\nImmediately  you may be confused where to find Kabuto. It is an unmarked door near Nakamura-Ya. Walk in. Do you see all white with some ovens? You're in Sweets Raku. Leave (but come back later). The other unmarked door. There you go. The place with the beautiful interior. Very Japanese in that the use of natural materials is prevalent. Wood. Stone. Simplicity. The food is being made right in front of the lucky customers sitting at the bar. Go ahead  take a picture.\\n\\nYour prix-fixe options are three. Basically  how much can you spend for how long of an experience? You can go up to $120  though I imagine the middle option is the most popular - which is what I had. It is plenty  but the higher tier is still appealing.\\n\\n1. You'll start with a drink. I had a Fuji apple infused sake  made in house  served over ice. Light and refreshing.\\n2. Next  a small dish of sliced bonito  seaweed  and cucumbers. A tease for what is to come.\\n3. Finally  a sashimi plate. Bluefin tuna  scallops  white fish  and oyster already with sauce. I'm usually the kind of person who tries everything on the plate - but avoid the stuff the oyster is sitting on. It's salt. Ask me how I know.\\n4. Next  a grilled plate. Three pieces of meat. One fish I don't recall the name of but it was topped with a sort of miso. The next  beef tataki. Tender and delicious  wrapping some vegetables. The last  wild trout.\\n5. Chopped bluefin tuna over rice. Simple and tasty.\\n6. Marinated ikura over rice. I was initially afraid of the fishy aspect of this  but like all things perfected - I had nothing to fear. The bursts of ikura while chewing were salty but delicious in the mystery marinade and rice.\\n7. A bluefin hand roll  but not of the conical variety. More like a small sushi roll but uncut. Simple  and still delicious. Appreciated familiarity.\\n8. A series of nigiri. Some I don't remember  but I know there was cho-toro (medium fatty tuna). I also ordered extra young yellowtail and o-toro.\\n9. When you're all done  you'll have a choice of miso soup with a variety of items. Fish bone  shrimp head  or seaweed (I think). I tried both the fish bone and the shrimp head. Both delicious and comforting ends to the \\\"\"\"\"sushi phase.\\\"\"\"\"\\n10. Dessert. I got to try the roasted tea ice cream and the citrus sorbet. Both excellent  particularly the sorbet. Extremely refreshing and flavorful.\\n\\nFor a high-end sushi experience  you will probably never find better in Vegas. This isn't a place to get value  or to get full. This is an experience. Remember this. Eat slowly. Take the time to think about what you're eating. Enjoy.\"",

What I experienced could not have surprised me more.  \\n\\nI love massages.  A lot.  So I would never tell someone to give them up. But if you want to take bodywork and care for your self to the next level  try MFR.  If you want to try MFR  try this place.  Rowena is an incredible therapist and has an amazing touch.  I am very picky as to who I'll let work on me and could not recommend her more.  \\n\\nEven though this was a new arena for me  I felt calm  collected  and comfortable the entire session.  I felt incredibly soothed from the minute I stepped into the treatment room  and my relaxed state deepened even further when Rowena placed her hands on me.  The next 90 minutes was sort of a blur and seemed to last 5 minutes and an eternity all at the same time.  All I know is I haven't felt that good in years.  I also felt the work for several days afterwards and continue to have releases in my fascia almost a week later  which is how I truly rate bodywork.  Anyone can make you feel good during a regular massage  but TRUE bodywork is felt in the hours and days after the session.  This work passes that test  and then some.\\n\\nI cannot recommend MFR or Rowena enough.

Think a hybrid between Neapolitan style and New York style. Exceptional ingredients that are perfectly portioned with the crust. Oh the crust  light  yet firm  a with a nice crunch on the edge yet soft and pillowy inside. The crust in the center holds up to the toppings with ease. By the slice  by the pie  heck buy the slice or buy the pie. Four styles to choose from with an additional 4 on the way in the next few weeks...including a vegan variety. An entiere pie will run you about $22  by the slice-$3.50 Pop Up Pizza is located on the south end of The Plaza  just as you enter the front door from Main St. Run  do not walk to this place. Soon the lines will be out the door  up Fremont Street  then all the way down Las Vegas Blvd to the Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo. Yeah  it's that good.",

Pop Up Pizza just happens to be about 3 blocks away.\\n\\nFirst off  the place is located inside The Plaza Hotel and Casino. You can park in the Plaza parking lot for 5 bucks cash only (free for those that are gold or platinum or whatever card you need that the sign says at the gate). Dont worry though  keep your parking receipt  have the attendant at PUP stamp your parking receipt after you pay for your food  and then take that stamped receipt to the cashier at the cashier cage about 50 yards away so they can give you your 5 bucks back.\\n\\nAs you go up to the counter  you can see garlic knots and all the pizza that is available for purchase by the slice. If you refer to my pic  they have this combo menu right on counter. You have 6 options. I picked combo number 1 which is any two slices and a large soda for 7.99. I selected a slice of the Harris Meatball Pie and the Fremont.\\n\\nThe Harris Meatball Pie: Mozzarella  classic Italian meatballs  caramelized onions  olives and topped with fresh basil. Nuff said.\\nThe Fremont: Mozzarella  Italian sausage  bacon  pepperoni  roasted peppers  and roasted eggplant. Again  nuff said.\\n\\nThe only negatives I observed is that when you park in the Plaza parking lot  you gotta walk past the Greyhound bus station. That place in itself is a whole other review. http://www.yelp.com/biz/greyhound-bus-lines-las-vegas#query:greyhound%20bus%20station\\nAlso  where the seating area is for PUP is basically in the wide open portion of the casino itself  meaning that whatever secondhand smoke is lingering around will give your pizza the smoke flavoring that you dont want.\\n\\nSome random info: I was told there was free wifi but I couldnt get it to work for me. The domain is popup pizza. The password is popuppizza1. They are open daily from 11 am to 2 am for you guys that have the munchies late at night.\\n\\nIn closing  I think their thin crust pizza is pretty good. Its just the 5 dollar parking that you eventually get back  the scenic route to PUP  and the unwanted added secondhand smoke flavoring to my pizza that kind of ruins the moment.\\n\\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #94",

The pizza was perfect  one of the best NY style pies you will find in town without a doubt. The salad was the show stopper though!

Just mediocre.  I've eaten at nobu and morimoto which were exceptionally better. Even the dessert chocolate cake was dry and unappetizing.\\n\\nThe service was another disappointment. I normally don't like to comment on service for restaurants because I've always held food taste to be of highest importance. But  when the poor service means I don't get my food  we got problems. Getting a waiter to help was worse than hailing a NYC taxi cab on a rainy Friday night.  We were looking around for a server and they deliberately avoided eye contact and ran the other direction. It happened multiple times. \\n\\nWhen we didn't receive our sake order 30 minutes in to our dinner we asked to speak to the manager.

This course was a waste and I would recommend sticking to apps and pizza and maybe walking down to Dean & Deluca for a good dessert.  I think the desserts+coffees with one shot of Baileys was around $30.  The total bill was $121 + tip.  I would be choosier with the order next time because while it was fantastic  you could still have a great meal and dodge some of the expense.

This is my first time living this close to the inner city  and it's perfect for my current situation. Number one factor was that they accepted my pit bull (upon meeting her). Secondly  I'm not having to deal with the witch hunts of intrusive HOAs and nosey neighbors with sticks up their asses. I feel very comfortable here  and foresee no major issues that would convince me that I haven't made the right choice moving in. And it has to be said again  I'm looking out my windows right now and I'm just in awe of this view!!",

It was 7:30pm  about 30 minutes before the Deli was supposed to close and I was treated no differently than as if I was the first customer of the day. The owner recommended  the Surfin Bird for me (Turkey  Avocado  Bacon  Cream Cheese*  Lettuce  Tomato  Mayo). Why the asterisk? Let me tell you why. Because cream cheese on a sammich is one of the greatest things I have ever tasted in the history of my tasting. It was that good. Maybe others already knew this secret  but I didn't. My wife isn't much of a turkeyer  so she took the owners recommendation as he said  and I quote  \\\"\"\"\"the whole reason I opened this place is because of the Surfin' Cow.\\\"\"\"\" Cowabunga. Same ingredients as the Surfin Bird  just minus the bird and exchange it for Roast Beef. Served hot or cold  she chose cold.

Instead of feeling like I needed to rush out (which I probably would have done had I worked there) the owner came up to us and asked how everything was as.

I have had many  many pulled pork sandwiches and it is the first thing I try at all barbecue joints. I have to say this sandwich was heaven on a bun. The pork is perfect - not too moist  not too dry  with a nice bark on it. The sauce is wonderful - the perfect mix of tangy  sweet and smoky. But the piece de resistance is the bun - it's a brioche bun that they toast perfectly so every bite has a amazing crunch to it.  I think I'll be dreaming about this sandwich...\\nI tried my husband's brisket and it was great too (although I have to say I still think the best brisket I have ever had is a friend of mine's who does competitions) - moist with a nice bark (if you can't tell  I love bark on my barbecued meats) and very lean. \\nThe beans were also fantastic - really spicy  which I love. But if you like your food mild  you might want to pass. The mac n' cheese is also very nice and creamy with a little sharpness to the cheese.\\nThe only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the burnt ends weren't quite as burnt and as full of bark as I like them  but I am an enthusiastic love of lots of bark as I have already mentioned. I think I will try the redneck tacos next time if we want an appetizer. \\nWe were too full for dessert  but someone at the next table got some amazing looking chocolate chip cookies that came with a glass of milk that almost changed my mind. Maybe next time... and there will definitely be a next time!",

We were looking for burgers and decided to go for Dave's  which is less than 10 minutes from our new home. And yes  it is in a Chevron gas station!    Wow.  I really don't understand most of the reviews here.  When we arrived (our second trip since they are not open on Sunday) it is true that there was no one at the counter  but it took about 3 minutes for one of the employees to ask us if we were needing to place an order.  We asked for a minute to look at the menu board.  She gave us a very friendly smile and let us look. (it was very clear they had been on their break  this is a small operation)  Just a minute or two later the other employee and cook  Michael  came to the counter.  His smile and bright eyes literally lit up the place.  \\n\\nWe ordered two #2 burgers with everything (that includes a double decker burger with cheese  lettuce  tomato  onion  pickle and  special sauce for $6.95)  plus bacon and onion rings ($1.00 each  if you want).  He asked if we had our coupon.  We said it was our first time here (we gathered what to order from previous posts) and he declared that we MUST have a coupon  and then proceeded to comp us all our upgrades (bacon  jalepenos  and onion rings) in addition to then handing us a coupon for 25% off any orders over $10.00 on further meals.  Michael was very jovial and pleasant  and made us feel like we were old  treasured customers.\\n\\nThe burgers arrived after about 10-15 minutes.  You could tell everything is cooked to order  including the fries and onion rings.  The burgers were double decker  lightly seasoned and very fresh meat  with the cheese melted and the bacon applied to both layers of the burger.  All the ingredients were fresh...crisp tomato and lettuce  dill pickles that were crisp and tart  not the sad  limp sweet pickles most places put on their burgers.  They were truly flavorful and delicious.  \\n\\nNormally we would take pictures first  but these burgers looked and tasted so good  that upon the first bite  both my husband and I macked them down within about 5 minutes.  That is how good they were!  And this is from someone that usually cannot even finish half of a single burger without saving it for later!  And the onion rings were superb!  Beer battered  golden brown  crisp deliciousness!  When you take a bite  the onion does NOT slide out of the ring  as most do.  They are tender  but crisp and very flavorful.  \\n\\nWe were happy enough with the experience to talk about going back for dinner that night and breakfast the next day to try the breakfast burritos that they have all day!  We did go back 2 days later to try some of their sandwiches  that I will post about soon  but needless to say  we have NOT had a bad experience here at all and recommend the food (at a gas station  no less!)  for it's freshness  quality  price and staff.",

Was very good and we WILL return due to the food and great customer service. Thank you guy manager! It was appreciated. It was worth the wait for the Fresh Pozole",

Best sliders I've had EVER. My only complaint would be that they are a tad bit oily  but the buns they are served on were awesome...soft and a bit crispy at the same time. I had to seriously pace myself because I could have honestly gobbled down a double order. My honey had chicken with his pad thai and the chicken was very soft and tender (I did taste a little of his dish). I had a taro smoothie with my dinner which was wonderful by the way  my only complaint being that I didn't think it was worth the $5.00 price for a large size. Our waitress was so cute and very attentive  we didn't have any qualms with her service  it was right on and she was the only waitress waiting on about 6 tables. We will definitely be back  though I'm scared to try other dishes due to the many negative reviews. Also  this place is right between EString bar and grill and Valle Verde Casino on Sunset Road  if you're going down Sunset and you blink  you will probably miss it and have to go all the way around the block again.

I called and told them about my phone number and I assumed she changed it.

When you are dealing with people's medical insurance it is vitally important that you get all of their information correct.

Frankly it was quite forgettable.\\n\\nTo set the stage  it's Restaurant Week winter 2013 and I've heard some good things about 5Church and as part of the purpose of this event  this was a great opportunity to try a new place without breaking the bank.  I went ahead and made reservations for 6:00.  I got the impression that our babysitters were going to be a bit late and I called 5Church around 12:30pm and asked to move out our reservation time by about 30 minutes.  I couldn't hear the Hostess on the other end and she couldn't hear me because of the ridiculously loud blaring music behind her.  I got the \\\"\"\"\"lazy\\\"\"\"\" answer of that they were packed to the gills and there was no room for me to push out the time.  Fine  it worked out and we got there 5 minutes prior to 6:00.  When we got there the 3 hostesses were pretty snotty and couldn't be bothered and asked us to wait at the bar which was fine  but I walked past a nearly empty dining room to get the the bar.  I never get the whole overstaffing of hosts / hostesses thing.  Also  these people are the first impression you get when you walk in and to have them not be welcoming and efficient is a bad start to the experience.  \\n\\nAt 6:20 we finally got seated only when I went and bothered the ladies at the hostess stand again  saying we were ready to be seated.  We walked upstairs and we were seated right next to the kitchen (Awesome right?).  They had these slim swinging doors which were constantly being kicked open and swinging loudly revealing the mishmosh of the kitchen.  It wasn't going to work for me and I asked to be reseated.  We were sat on the other side of the upstairs bar right under a speaker blaring music and I realized this was where the hostess that I spoke to earlier must have been standing when she took my call because I couldn't hear myself think let alone carry on my usual pleasant conversation with Sweetie.  Great  I should have packed my earplugs.\\n\\nOK  onto the food.  I decided to forego the Restaurant Week Menu and ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and 60 Second NY Strip and Lobster Mac & Cheese.  The crispy pork belly app was tasty  I must say.  Crispy and well plated  it made for a nice culmination of flavors and it made things started turn around for me.  If I couldn't hear Sweetie because of the music at least I can enjoy the food.  The 60 second steak is awesome.  It is made in a cast iron skillet and never flipped but cooked through so that one side is cooked more but the other side is perfectly rare and cooked to temperature.  It was plated with a nice signature sauce by their chef which was both tangy and smokey....nicely done  it was the perfect compliment to the steak.  The lobster mac and cheese was disappointing and was just a saucer of mac and cheese completely void of lobster.  For $9.00 I expected more and it was a bit insulting to not have any more than a morsel of lobster.  I suggest they take a short walk to the Capital Grille to learn how that dish should be prepared.\\nSweetie had the wasabi encrusted salmon  which was bland and forgettable.  She expected to taste wasabi and got nothing.  Not much else to say.  \\n\\nService was half and half  the waitress popped in at the right times for the most part but after dropping off the dessert menu we didn't see her for 20 minutes which was annoying since we were ready to go.  Sweetie went to the restroom came back reporting that there wasn't any soap in the dispenser which always makes you wonder how the servers are able to wash their hands.\\n\\nAll in all  my food was OK nothing spectacular and I don't think I'll be back.\"",

When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip  be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.\\n\\nSo bottom line ...

The result has been (in general) inconsistent service and food. \\n\\nThere are still a couple of great servers there  and if you get one of them  you'll have a pleasant experience. This past week  I ordered a chicken burrito for part of my meal; the burrito itself was fine but the sauce tasted disconcertingly like Ragu spaghetti sauce. (it should be noted  though  that they have the best salsa in town that I've found so far!) To top off the general decline  they raised their prices a couple of months ago.  As time passes  I'm finding fewer and fewer reasons to go back. Aside from hiring more enthusiastic servers  the one thing they could do to get back on track would be to get a little inventive with the menu. There's really nothing there that's different from any other Mexican restaurant in town  and what is different does not taste distinctive. How about getting back to basics -- street tacos  tortas  tlayudas  tostados?",

I don't use work out equipment I join only for the classes 2. I don't like the pressure you get to buy a better package or a trainer. I don't want any of that. 3. Some gyms are clean and some are not. I called because this location was close to my house. The guy on the phone was rude. I asked at least 5 different times and he literally would not give me any pricing over the phone. Not a range or anything. We started going back and forth telling me I need to come in and speak with him. Finally  after asking to speak with a manager and him telling me he was at lunch....I told him that the impression I've got over the phone was no good and I didn't know if I wanted to come in now...he said oh ok well I can tell you our packages start around $19.99 a month. How hard was that?! He didn't say bye he literally hung up. Wow exceptional customer service  makes me really want to come frequent your gym... NOT!!!!!",

I did my usual check in with yelp when we got to the restaurant  and to my surprise I got a check in offer! Free order of spring rolls with a purchase of an entree. Perfect! So I show our waiter and he said that the last time he asked the manager about this offer she refused to honor it. When businesses decide to do check in offers you would think they would be excited to honor it knowing that this is a review website. All managers and staff should be knowledgeable about any and all offers that their guest bring to the table. \\nThe next point I want to make is that we ordered steak medium well and it came out well done.

After about 30 minutes  we were told that we could wait in the bar for our table  that people were taking longer than expected to finish their meals.  We went into the bar area - which was empty - sat at the bar  and were ignored by the bartender for about 10 minutes before she even acknowledged we were there.  When I asked for a wine list  she gestured to the restaurant seating area and said they were \\\"\"\"\"all out there\\\"\"\"\" and handed me a cocktail list. Seeing that all of the cocktails and martinis were $8.75 and up  I chose to wait to have a glass of wine with my meal. An hour and 15 minutes after our reservation  another member of our party went to the hostess stand and asked if any of the empty tables were for us. We were told by the hostess that our drinks at the bar would be comped for our wait  and when I mentioned that I never saw a wine list  she said that she would comp all of the first round of drinks at our table.  \\n\\nWe waited about 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and bring us water  get our drink order  drop off the \\\"\"\"\"meat indicator\\\"\"\"\" for the meat servers to stop at our table. No one ever stopped  and we tried to flag down the hostess 3 times and were promptly ignored.  Finally a waiter walked by and one of our friends got his attention and told him we had not gotten any service. He apologized  said he would take care of us  and brought out water for everyone  and I told him that the hostess had agreed to comp our drinks.  He looked at me like I was crazy  so I told him about the wait we had experiences.  He shrugged and didn't respond.\\n\\nWe went and got our salad bar items  which were delicious and plentiful. The variety was great - mussels  shrimp and salmon on the bar  as well as a variety of salads  cheeses  and sliced deli meats. The cooked meat was delicious - the tri-tip steak and lamb were both cooked perfectly.  I tried several other portions and enjoyed it all.  \\n\\nThe waiter never came back by our table to refill our water glasses or ask if we wanted another drink from the bar.  He was very attentive to the table next to ours - spending 4 or 5 minutes chatting with them  making sure everyone had drinks and everything they needed.  Almost 3 hours after our reservation time  we flagged down another server and asked to see the manager.  Turns out that our \\\"\"\"\"waiter\\\"\"\"\" was actually the manager!  When we told him how disappointed we were with the service  he asked if he could bring us a dessert or another drink from the bar  which we declined  and asked for our bills.  He apologized again and brought us our bills.  Our drinks were comped  as the hostess promised.\\n\\nWe will probably never go back to Amor de Brazil.  The food was good  but the service was awful.\"",

Like a review below  it's a really nice facility.. on the outside...\\n\\nThey don't accept insurance here. so we paid cash for my mom to be there for rehab after a stroke. At first  I noticed some of the growing pains  forgetting my mom's dinner once  a little disorganized though their response time was usually good. We paid them thinking we would be getting some rehab every day. The weekends are really lax.. you might get some time  you might not. They try to increase the rehab time during the week so the AVERAGE rehab time carries them through the weekend.  That looks great on paper  but when a patient comes here for rehab to get well  and the patient and family is expecting daily rehab  that was not given! the money paid on the weekend is the same as during the week.. seems like a bit of a rip off..\\n\\nThings I've noticed toward the end of her stay.. when she called for a nurse to help her  the time seemed to have gotten longer.. I went to the nurse's station to see what is taking so long  and saw one of the head nurses doing makeup  giving another nurse a flu shot or something  but it seemed like they were joking around .. unprofessional!! it almost seemed like I was being so bothersome to them asking them to attend to the call that my mom made for assistance.  In the end  that nurse didn't even come  she sent someone else to go see my mom.\\n\\nLastly  and this is the most important for people who are thinking about going there  when we were leaving the facility  I asked for all the meds we gave them prescriptions for. They said they can't dispense it to us. (I did see cards of 30 day meds for my mom) If they can't dispense it to us  and they accepted our prescriptions  WHAT do they do with the extra medicine?\\n\\nI had to go to the pharmacy that evening to get the meds she needed. The pharmacy did not have her blood pressure medication on hand  so it would be Monday until they could get it. (it was friday).. I called the facility back to see if they can just give me 3 to cover her for the weekend  and they once again said they can't dispense.. but I asked them again  what do they do with the medicine that they received with OUR prescription  and she yelled out to someone to ask what they do with the medicine  and she responded that she/they didn't know..\\n\\nIt seems really fishy to me.. medicine that was prescribed for my mom  should be my mom's.. it can't get reused for another patient?! maybe they're dealing on the side? If they were going to destroy it  they could have simply said that. what a waste and somehow i feel like there has to be some legal policy around this that is being broken.\\n\\nUnfortunately  it's truly slim pickings for rehab facilities here in Las Vegas...",

The only thing I didn't want to eat on the menu was chicken claws (although  according to Anita A these are great for your skin with all the collagen...) so instead we had to share amongst four folk: char sui pork buns; the pork and the prawn rice buns; mini ribs; beef won ton; duck spring roll; vietnamese spring roll; lots of other things.\\n\\nThe wee pork ribs were a bit too wee for me  but the beef won tons  duck spring rolls and vietnamese spring rolls were all little deep fried parcels of joy. Ample stuffing  and all very flavourful.\\n\\nThe food comes out very quickly  piping hot  and in an hour we had all tucked in and contented ourselves with many dim sum delights.\\n\\nI would say dim sum isn't my favourite type of cuisine generally  so I won't come back here regularly for that reason.

That's alright  but the waiter should have checked in on us a little more instead of just taking it for granted that we would tip him.  Or  maybe he was frightened of us?  \\n\\nFood was slow in getting to us  but not so slow that I would have walked out.  The music was too loud  it was distracting and made it seem like the wait was longer.  We got to stare at the pretentious decor for a little too long.  But  we figured if the food is good  it doesn't matter too much.  \\n\\nWe had gluten free pizzas with vegan cheese.  It was okay...they skimped on the vegan cheese horribly.  But  the pizza was hot when we got it so I guess that was a plus.  I was expecting it to be cold because the server seemed to avoid us...or maybe this was because it was so loud and he knew he couldn't hear us or it was hurting his hearing at the spot where we were?  Who knows.\\n\\nThe pizzas were not large enough.  We ordered two so we could take pizza back to another family member.  Both of us made an effort to stop eating so there would be enough to take with us. \\n\\nThe WORST part of it was discovering how much the bill was at the end.  This was a very expensive place to eat.  The prices were not clearly marked on the menu for the gluten-free things or I would probably have walked out in the beginning.  We were charged $3 extra for vegan cheese...but as I said they put so little on the pizzas.  So  the little pizzas we ordered ended up being $22 each  the drinks were $6 each  we got an appetizer and we had a $10 off coupon.  For two people to eat a pizza dinner it was $57 AFTER the coupon.  \\n\\nIt wasn't worth it.  I won't go back.  There's other places to eat.  I don't know if this place thinks it is trendy and that makes it worth it?  I was looking forward to eating there because I heard about it from a few people that went to the other location in Phoenix.  The ambiance didn't make up for any of it.\\n\\nAnyhow...work on your pricing  work on your service and train your servers to be more attentive  and maybe turn down your music so people can enjoy themselves instead of feeling tortured.  Or maybe this is so people don't linger too long?  But then again if that were it  the food would have come faster?\\n\\nThe place wasn't all that busy for a Saturday night at 7:30  but finding a place to park was difficult.  \\n\\nMellow Mushroom needs to work on things a bit.  :)  I know that gluten free  vegan fare is somehow more expensive....but this was a little ridiculous.",

First  our flight was canceled in Seattle so we decided to call reservation while waiting to  talk to a customer service agent in person.  I was a little hesitant with the customer service agent because I saw the way she was servicing the person before us. Of course no smile  no nothing  she dreaded our existence as if she did not want to be working. I asked her about our flight and she had no clue it was canceled due to maintenance  she basically told us she couldn't help us so i ask for a supervisor. The supervisor at the station had the worst attitude in customer service that I have ever encountered  believe me when i said that i stayed calm the whole time.  The supervisor did not know the reasoning for the canceled flight either until she paged someone. Her rude attitude was no acceptable. We had an event the moment we land and had to be in the Las Vegas Convention center right after so our urgency to get on the next flight was not a concern to them. I asked if it was possible to get on the next available flight or another airline  they did not want to help  they did not give us any options  no nothing. Noted the cancellation was due to maintenance and not weather related but they felt like they don't have to take ownership for it.  As to many other airlines they understand that maintenance is under their control and would find ways to help their customers.  The reasoning for not helping us was of course we are not a \\\"\"\"\"diamond member  as she stated something close to that.  We asked if it's possible to put us on stand by for the next flight  she finally did  and after we took a few steps away form the counter we heard the supervisor gossiping about the situation  yes very professional.   Feeling uneasy about the experience  the night before leaving Vegas we got down to the conference room in our hotel building  and realized they had screwed up our flight coming back from Vegas to Seattle. Of course  with the service and screw up they have given us in Seattle  we were not surprise at all. When we called reservations they tried to place the blame on something else! What a sh!t show. Alaska Airline can not take ownership of their own companies fault  they pass it around to anything that they could to make their company hold that image of being the better airline.  The no good agent and supervisors in the Seattle Airport was a joke  Please fire them. Terrible work ethic and customer service.  They represent your company and if this is the face of Alaska Airline why should we choose your mileage card compared to other Airlines? Especially with Alaska Airline's terrible service? We shared this information inside the Las Vegas Convection Center with several people and will be sharing this terrible service to many more  for even though we are not your \\\"\"\"\"Diamond members\\\"\"\"\" we are still your customers. We made the mistake of choosing your mileage program this past year. and now we know better. We know we fly frequently enough to know better that service should not be this terrible.  It was a big surprise for us due to the fact that Alaska Airline should be one of the best and from this experience  it was the worst out of the 8 flights i have taken this year.\"",

The last few times we have gone in we are met with an attitude of indifference at the door that seems to permeate the wait staff. Waited a long time to for our first contact with the waitress  though she was pleasant. Seems she had customers on the patio as well as inside and was spread thin  so it was a long time between visits. First beer came timely   but could not get the attention of anyone for a refill when our food came. A different waitress dropped off our food (and that was literally what she did) and quickly turned away and did not ask if we needed anything else. Furthermore  she went out of her way to avoid our conspicuous attempts to get her attention for something we needed. In the meantime our first waitress was busy on the patio and  apparently  waitress #2 was not happy that she had to serve us our food  because she continued to ignore our attempt to get her attention  even glaring and looking through me at one point. Although this was \\\"\"\"\"Trivia night\\\"\"\"\" (for the life of me I don't understand what a restaurant gets out of this since most participants seem to only buy drinks)  the place was not crowded or busy and there seemed to be plenty of employees to go around the room and tend to the customers that were present. This is only an account of the third bad experience we have had with service. There have been others  interspersed with satisfactory experiences. \\nWe both have many years in the restaurant business and our assessment of the reason for this uneven experience falls on management. First  choose people that are committed to the success of your business. There are many competitors out there waiting to take your place if you stumble. Second  management has the responsibility to make certain staff is well schooled in how to deal with customers  including the technique of scanning the room and making eye contact with those that seem to be looking for something. There are usually additional sales involved in doing this competently. Third  management needs to be present and observant so that when it is apparent things are not going well  they can do what they are paid to do  i.e. make it right. You only get so many bites at this apple HAPH  so you better get it right or Gilbert ends up with yet another vacant building with a \\\"\"\"\"For Lease\\\"\"\"\" sign in the window.\"",

I had the hash brown burrito the first time and he had the huevos rancheros. My burrito had nothing but a fried egg  a little but of hash browns.. And bacon. Then  my last 4 bites or so had sausage. No sour cream  pico  cheese... Very plain. His had the eggs with what was definitely canned enchilada sauce.. The refried beans were no better than the canned beans you an buy at the store. The second time we tried a fish taco and burrito... Same experience. The fish had no flavor and was overly fried. I think Los Favoritos close by is way better for a fast food Mexican!",

I expected to find something special about their food since their prices were higher then I usually pay  but it wasn't. My kids got the rolled tacos and when I tried one it was bland and greasy. I got the chicken fajita quesadilla  and was very disappointed. The quesadilla was more like a burrito with so much filling that the entire bottom was soggy and in edible. The onions and peppers inside were cut in so many different sizes that some pieces were burnt and some weren't cooked at all. My husband got the taco enchilada plate. The sauce had way too many different flavors going on.  The only part of the meal that was good was the rice.

Instead of buying another new van  I decided to take a look at smaller  cuter cars with better gas mileage and just demote the mom-van to road trips and costco.\\n\\nI always dread car-buying time and view it as a necessary evil.  I'm not a car person and I don't get excited about the prospect of something new to drive  so all the hassle of research  negotiation  paperwork is doubly annoying.  I always attempt to make first contact by email to see which dealers will work with me on my own terms.  I'm at home with 5 kids and I'm the only driver in the house.  I don't have the time or head space to drive all over town comparing prices  features  etc.  That's why we have the internet!  The problem is  so many car dealers are still stuck back in 1985.  \\\"\"\"\"You seem to have a lot of questions!\\\"\"\"\" they'll say  \\\"\"\"\"Come on down so we can answer them all for you!\\\"\"\"\"  No.  If I'm throwing 20 grand or more around  I want to have time to think about it.\\n\\nRob at Autonation was the first to respond to my email with a detailed answer.  We hammered out all the details in a series of emails throughout the day as I made lunch  helped with Math  brushed out tangles  or in traffic (ssh!  Always at the red lights!).  That is literally the only way I can buy a car.  Rob is a sweetheart. When I finally narrowed my search to two cars and went in to test drive  he had them tucked away in the garage and had carved out as much time from his day as I needed.  He walked me through all the features  had ready answers to all my questions  and  never insulted my intelligence or made me feel stupid.  He provided a concierge-like service the likes of which I've never experienced at a car dealership  even when we bought my husband's BMW back in the day before the economy crashed.  Sigh.\\n\\nAnyway  you still have to do your homework (Rob L. down below  I'm looking at you  guy...that information is all over the internet!) and know what you're buying  what it is worth  and what you can afford.  They're going to haggle.  They're in business of selling cars.  But I never felt like someone was trying to do an end run around me.  Negotiations were straight forward and I walked away satisfied that I got plenty for my money.  \\n\\nThanks guys!  Maybe I'll pop in sometime and say hi when I'm up that way visiting my daughter :)\"",

        "text": "\"Bought a car with DUCT TAPE holding a part together! Really. Here's the story. \\n\\nBought a used Ford Expedition from them on Saturday afternoon  September 20th. Three salesman sat in the air conditioned office watching my husband go over this vehicle for 45 minutes in 100+ degree heat. My husband knows a thing or two about cars. He seemed satisfied and we completed the sale late in the day  near 5:00. \\n\\nOn Sunday morning my husband continued his inspection at home and found a loose idle pulley (about a $35 dollar part). He could see a definite mechanical issue  a small one  but still. Auto Nation Fiat said \\\"\"\"\"NO\\\"\"\"\" to that repair  saying we bought the vehicle \\\"\"\"\"as is.\\\"\"\"\" So much for being proud of selling a vehicle in proper mechanical working condition right off the lot. \\n\\nBUT here is the kicker...and this is NOT A JOKE. We found  LOOPS OF DUCT TAPE holding the cowl (the black vent-looking piece that sits between the front hood and the base of front windshield) onto the vehicle. They were across the whole length of the vehicle and there was evidence of DUCT TAPE that had been there but removed. DUCT TAPE? REALLY? \\n\\nBy the time we processed our decisions about this vehicle it was about 3:30 on Sunday afternoon and tried to call our salesman  who had just left for the day. The voicemail box we were directed to was not his. We had been in email contact so we sent him an email saying we would be returning the car the following day  as per the 3-Day satisfaction guaranteed policy of Auto Nation. He would have had that email as soon as he checked in the morning. And he was at work on Monday  conveniently at another location. \\n\\nWe returned the vehicle on Monday afternoon  to find out that our salesman  MATT LOWNEY  failed to inform the business office of our intention to return it  so they went ahead and processed our partial credit card  partial personal check to the total sum of $12 000+. The woman in the office told me directly that had she known we were returning it  she would NOT have processed the transactions. This point was later contradicted by the \\\"\"\"\"manager of finance\\\"\"\"\" who said they processed everything immediately. I hate it when people in the same business tell different stories. It really brings down the integrity of the business. Not that duct tape doesn't do the same thing! \\n\\nThe credit transaction was refunded on the spot  but it turns out that I had to prove that my check had cleared my bank before they could initiate my personal check refund. I did that on Thursday  September 25th and was assured a check would be sent immediately. As of today  October 8th  I have not received my $7000+ dollars. Rhetorical question - are they earning interest on my money while I wait? \\n\\nWe have been very neutral through this entire process  until I called and asked to speak with the \\\"\"\"\"finance manager\\\"\"\"\" on September 30th  who knew nothing about this. Really? REALLY? This is a pretty small dealership and you have to admit  this is a pretty good story.  With assurances that he would look into it and get back to me the next day  I continued to remain neutral  understanding that corporations are fabulous at creating layers of paperwork. BUT WHEN HE DIDN'T CALL ME THE NEXT DAY  I got MAD. So I called and asked about the status of my money and got a very vague \\\"\"\"\"I'm sure it is in the mail answer.\\\"\"\"\" So much for customer service. After selling me a car with duct tape. So yes  I'm kind of mad  and I think the public should be aware of our experience.\"",

I told her about the offer on yelp for a free sweet tea with entree purchase and she asked that I just bring it with me and I would be fine. \\nWhen I arrived the man at the register was in the back and came out complaining about another employee. He said to a client waiting for her order  \\\"\"\"\"You see what I have to deal with!?\\\"\"\"\"  He and that client proceeded to have an exchange about the other employee's \\\"\"\"\"attitude\\\"\"\"\" while 3 other clients awaited his service. Needless to say  the lady in front of me (who was next in line) was displaying perturbed body language  which he completely disregarded. \\nWhen it was my turn  he asked for my order and I stated that I'd already called in for a pick up order. Instead of asking for my name and looking it up in their system  he proceeded to play a guessing game  that took about a minute and a half. Finally  he asked my name and said it should be out shortly. I informed him of the yelp coupon (that's available with check in) for the sweet tea. He condescendingly stated  \\\"\"\"\"Ya'll be usin' these old coupons! Here's the coupon we got right now.\\\"\"\"\" He then passed me a folded copy of the menu (yeah the menu!). I explained him that I was confident it was valid as it was on the yelp page and was only available with check-in. He angrily went and got the tea and told me my total was $8.45. When I pulled out my card he said  \\\"\"\"\"That will be $9.45.\\\"\"\"\"  I explained to him that he'd just given me a different total and he said that was because of the tax. At this point  I didn't want to argue over the dollar. \\n\\nWhen he brought me my order he complained about the bag  clearly trying to blame the other employee. He got a new bag. I checked my order and started to leave. He said  \\\"\"\"\"We good?\\\"\"\"\"  instead of offering a genuine apology. At which point  I just walked off. \\n\\nNow on to the food...\\n\\nThe whiting was hot and delicious. \\nThe cabbage tasted like it had been sitting for days and had a light brown tint versus the typical green color. It had a strange aftertaste. \\nThe black eyes peas tasted like they'd been sitting as well and were bland and watery.\\nThe cornbread muffin was dry and lackluster. \\nThe tea was perfectly sweetened. \\n\\nThe one on N.

I choose Kimpton's since I travel with my dog and I appreciate their pet policy but even beyond that  they have phenomenal customer service and modern  comfortable rooms.\\n\\nFor this hotel  they have a bar and restaurant onsite  as well as a rooftop pool. No onsite gym  but there's a golds gym across from the hotel that's free for hotel guests. I was pleasantly surprised as it was similar to equinox  which is much better than a small hotel gym. As all other Kimpton's have  they do their daily comp happy hour from 5-6 pm which is nice. The only downfalls of this hotel were parking ($27/day which is not common in Phoenix) and rooms only had one air vent by the window.\\n\\nOverall  I've been very happy with my stay and next time I'm in Arizona  I'd definitely stay here again as opposed to somewhere in old town Scottsdale.",

Thankfully  our server made up for her shortcomings  plus some.  He was fantastic.  Very attentive and very personable.\\n\\nIf only the food was as good as the service.  Ugh...such a let down!  I ordered Mild Wings.  The sauce was ok  but the skin was too soft.  My son got the Medium spiced wings and he said that they were ok  but that he's had better.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and said it was acceptable.  Nothing special  but not terrible either.  He also got a small order of Cajun spiced boneless wings.  I tried them and the flavor was NOT appealing to me at all.  The one saving grace for the entire meal were the onion rings.  A tad too salty  but perfectly crispy and not greasy.  My son and I liked them very much.\\n\\nThe decor is a bit gaudy  but I'm fairly certain that's by design.  I'm glad that we were seated at a booth because the plastic lawn chairs at the standard tables would have been very uncomfortable.  The only downside to the booth was that I was a bit grossed out by how filthy the framed picture was that was hanging over our booth.  It looked like some kids smeared their dirty hands all over the picture.  Seriously  it was disgusting and it even had an odor.  And speaking of odors...there was an odor in the restaurant that reminded of me the remnants of water damage.

Then when they finally left  he answered the phone and tended to other tenants who had walked in  not giving me any attention at all.\\nThere was no follow up after I was shown the model. Since I liked the location I figured I would move there. Every time I called  I had to leave a message  no one answered the phone. It would take a day or two for him to get back to me.\\nI handed in my application  and a girl called me back that day. I was very happy that she seemed much more in to customer service than the man. But that was all. She said she would call back in two days after the application process came back. She did not. I called the next day  and of course had to leave a message. She never returned my call. I had to call a couple more times to get a hold of her. She sent me the lease via email and the dates were wrong  so i emailed her back. She never returned my emails. I told her I wanted to see the apartment the day before I moved in to make sure it was what I wanted before signing the lease. She never called  nor returned my messages and emails asking for this. I got her temporary assistant on the line who said there was nothing she could do  as the manager had gone home for the day. \\nSo the day I was suppose to move in  I went to another complex. I figured if the customer service was this lousy as a perspective customer  how would it be if I ever needed something fixed  or anything else I was having problems with. Within 2 hours  I had looked at an apartment  filled the application  signed the lease  and moved in! The best thing about Chazal  besides the location  is how good it makes other apartment properties look!\\nOh  and of course  I never had any sort of follow up to ask why I hadn't moved in the day I was suppose to from Chazal....",

        "text": "Food: Ginza offers traditional Japanese cuisine ranging from hibachi to sushi to noodles  with plenty of appetizers and deserts as well. We started with the miso soup  which was just fine and warmed us up on a cold winter night. We followed with the edamame appetizer. Its hard to mess up edamame  and Ginza definitely didn't  but the dish could have used more seasoning to make an otherwise average dish stand out. There were other interesting appetizer choices  like seaweed salad  fresh spring rolls  and avocado salad  all of which are probably worth considering instead of the edamame. We then ordered the vegetable sushi roll  which contained avocado  asparagus  and cucumber (any of these could also be ordered individually within a roll). The roll consisted of six large pieces and was fresh and well made. There were four enticing vegetarian entrees on the menu; tofu vegetable teriyaki  tofu tempura  vegetable hibachi  and vegetable udon noodles. The udon noodles can be prepared pan-fried or in broth soup-style. The pan-fried udon noodles were quite bland  covered in a sauce that had little to no flavor or spice. The tofu teriyaki was slightly more interesting  with a thicker  more tasty sauce  but wasn't anything memorable and some of the vegetables were cold on the inside. The tofu was prepared crunchy out the outside but very wet and soft on the inside. Ginza does not put any hot sauce  pepper seeds  or chili paste on the table  and also do not offer a spiciness scale  so you can't really adjust what you get on your plate to accomodate for a lack of flavor. The lead-ins to the main course were not bad but not great  and the entrees were pretty lackluster. Overall  it seems as if Ginza doesn't have experience designing and preparing vegetarian items. Meat and fish eaters would likely have more success finding something satisfying.\\n\\nPrice: The prices were very reasonable  as we ordered two soups  an appetizer  a sushi roll  and two entrees for under $30. We were hungry  so we didn't have enough left to bring home (although we may not have taken leftovers anyways due to lack of flavor)  but the portion sizes are above average. \\n\\nDrinks: Ginza is BYOB but they do offer Japanese teas and sodas in addition to regular fountain drinks.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is decorated very nicely with darkly painted walls and candlelit tables. There are tables for small and large parties  and enough space so that you aren't sitting directly on top of your neighbors. However  the restaurant is basically one big room and when the door opens on a cold night  you can feel the chilly air rush in if you are anywhere near the front. It isn't too difficult to find a parking spot on Liberty or one of its side streets.\\n\\nService: We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and provided menus and glasses of water. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive  often checking our table and re-filling our water. We requested an addition of tofu to the udon noodles  which the waitress approved  but when the plate came the tofu was missing. We were also served our appetizer  sushi  and entrees within five minutes of each other  creating a table full of hot food getting cold.\\n\\n(+): cheap prices  large portions\\n\\n(-): average to below-average vegetarian food\\n\\nWould I go back again? Probably not  although I wouldn't stop a meat-eating friend from giving Ginza a shot.",

We definitely had waaaaay better Korean food.  (Stay tuned for my next review of it).  \\n\\nThe outside actually looked pretty good.  Yes  quite opposite from other restaurants we go to (Hmmm...interesting...).  We went on a Tuesday about 430pm so it wasn't crowded at all.  There was just one other person sitting there   The lady that 'somewhat' greeted us looked like she was one of the owners. I say 'somewhat' because she was distracted with her Korean shows that was blaring from the TV situated in the middle of the restaurant   She was in front of that TV every chance she got.\\n\\nWe played it safe and ordered the bulgogi and chicken.  The dishes were $14.95 each   They only had the \\\"\"\"\"cooking\\\"\"\"\" menu open at that time so we didn't have much of a choice.  They had soups and other appetizers but we opt not to have any.  I really wanted to try the seafood pancake but it was $16.95 (pretty steep for me).

It had been packed the previous weekend  with a front window that opens up onto the great terrasse on Avenue Mont-Royal.  Terrasse was unfortunately closed on this particular night as the permit was in transition  so we sat inside.\\n\\nOur fab serveuse  Emilie  was very quick to serve us and knowledgeable on the beers on tap.  Saint-Sacrament has house blonde and rousse brews  the former of which isn't stupendous in terms of taste but is rather good  and one could imagine sinking quite a few over the course of a Saturday night.  Other beers on tap include Stella Artois  Hoegaarden  Alexander Keith's  and a couple others -- nothing out-of-the-ordinary.\\n\\nThe bar seemed not quite as well-stocked as it could be  but the place does not profess to be a nightclub or cocktail bar  and Emilie was able to improvise where necessary.  It is  quite directly  a tavern.\\n\\nAmbiance was really where Saint-Sacrament has things kicking on all cylinders.  Amazing long wooden tables made from reclaimed wood are at bar-stool height  and are great for larger groups.  (I anticipate if you show up at a decent hour on a weekend  you won't have to contort to ask for chairs from other tables.)  Fantastic tin ceiling.  There are about four or five individual and properly-interior-designed washrooms in the back.  Place is spotless  and the music is fantastic: good mix of Rolling Stones (\\\"\"\"\"Bitch\\\"\"\"\"!  Hadn't heard that in years)  Johnny Cash  and other proper pub music blasting over a great sound system.  After cranking the music up louder at one point  one of the proprietors actually came over to make sure our table wasn't disturbed by the volume  since we were right under the speaker.  Nice touch there  too.  (Considering the quality of the music we weren't disturbed at all.)  There's at least one TV in there; it was being used for a Euro repeat when we arrived  but as the night wore on it was shut off in favour of the music  which is entirely proper for any reputable establishment.\\n\\nDidn't try any of the food  but everything coming out of the kitchen looked nice.  Prices for the beer and liquor are very modest for a watering hole that has a proper sense of design and great service about it.  Bottom line: certainly worth spending a few hours in here if you're in the Plateau on a weekend night (or even a weeknight).

(Of course  this is not to be confused with the service also known as body shampoos found at places with questionable intentions.)\\n\\nWhen inquiring about this service  we were led passed the chairs reserved for foot massages and into the back room.  This room had three massage beds with sinks specifically built attached to them.  The Husband and I then had our shoulders covered with a towel and plastic to prevent those areas from getting wet and we laid down with our heads over the sink.  This is where the similarities ended.\\n\\nThe person I had was Mark.  I have long hair.  He started to massage my scalp for a little while before turning the water on to wet my hair.  He then shampooed my hair and spent a considerable amount of time 'scratching' my scalp.  This is something that can be enjoyable and quite relaxing depending on the person and the circumstance  but it was just okay this time.  He then also did some cranial pressure before rinsing my hair of the shampoo and applying conditioner.  He made a point of making sure my hair was completely conditioned as he ran a comb through it all.  And then he rinsed all the conditioner out and squeezed some of the water out of my hair.  I was then instructed to get up so we could walk to a smaller room where he would blow dry my hair.  He then dried my hair and ran a brush through it to get rid of any tangles.  And then I was done.  Unfortunately  my hair was still a bit damp and the bottom half of my shirt in the back was all wet from the walk from the sink to the blow drying room.  (Perhaps he could have wrapped my hair in a towel to prevent that from happening.)  He apologized for the wet shirt part but I had to go blow dry my shirt as a result.  \\n\\n3 stars.\\n\\nMeanwhile  the Husband has practically no hair and he had Reao.  He said he didn't get that much scratching  but more pressure on his scalp  face  and shoulders.  While I was getting my hair blow dried  he was still getting cranial work done.  He felt so relaxed that he almost fell asleep.  He tried to inquire about what other services would take place if we had chosen the 60 minute option  but Reao did not quite understand him.  She thought he was trying to extend his experience to the 60 minute one.  He wanted to know if they were going to focus more on the scalp  shoulders  or face.  He really enjoyed it and would do it again.  \\n\\n4.5 stars from him.\\n\\nI think I lost out on the experience because: \\n\\na) I had a guy.  (And unfortunately I believe he smelled of cigarette smoke.  So with my sensitive sense of smell  and him running his hands through my hair  it was distracting.)  \\n\\nb) I have long hair.  Because so much time was spent shampooing  conditioning  and blow drying  there was less time for cranial work. Yes  I know it's called a head shampoo but you know you're really there for good cranial work.  It's almost like a glorified hair shampooing experience at your local salon.  \\n\\nOverall  I think if you're a bald guy  you may just love it.  Half the experience at a hair salon is getting your head shampooed and massaged and this place focuses on that part.  Unfortunately  I just didn't get that many head tingles from the experience like I was hoping for!  Would I go back?  Maybe - if I cut my hair and/or if I get a girl next time.  Some girls just know how to massage the scalp better  maybe it's the nail thing? \\n\\n30 minutes = $25\\n60 minutes = $48\\n60 minutes combo = $45 (30 minute head shampoo and 30 minute reflexology)\\n\\nThey are located exactly next door to Ichiza.  Great if you're waiting to dine there  bad when you're looking for a parking space!",

There are three sweet crepes - nutella and bananas  cream and berries  and a house special of cr\\u00e8me brulee. The savory crepes include a burrito and a few others (sorry  can't remember!). Husband and I ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte. As we waited for our food  we watched the burrito go by and decided we'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split. My latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top  delivered by a smiling employee. First sip - heavenly. (One of the better lattes I've had recently and I'm a coffee snob.) Quickly our crepes followed  looking beautiful on pristine  white plates. There were strawberries  blueberries  and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy  but definitely filling. Husband requested caramel be drizzled over his  adding a sweeter taste to his crepe. Crepe was light and airy  no crispy edges and just sweet enough. The cream and berries were definitely fresh.\\n\\nThe location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic. Committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food  it's gotta be good  right? Damn straight. The inside is a bit sparse  I don't remember any wall art  but there are plenty of tables and chairs. On the steel counter top  instead of a regular cash register  they use an iPad - which gives them cool techie cred. You can also see the chef at work  which is nice to see where the food comes from. \\n\\nOverall  I would definitely recommend this place to take your date  relatives  friends  maybe even strangers - just gather them all up and prepare for deliciousness.",

It's located southbound on Arville St.  make a left after the neon purple lingerie novelty shop. \\n\\nIt's HIGHLY recommended to make an appointment here. It was busy and completely packed with guests when I walked in. Luckily  we made an appointment  but due to a miscommunication it was suppose to be for four not three. Since I arrived 10 mins early and checked in. Dina  who was at the front desk asked me for the last four digits of my phone number  but I told her my friend is the one that made this appointment and it should have been for four not three. She was kind enough to change and accompany us in this last minute mix up. \\n\\nAs I was waiting for the rest of my group  a party of five and a couple walked in without an appointment. Instead of bumping us like in nightclubs for table reservations.. there wasn't any greed here. I admire Dina for being loyal to her appointments and letting the walkins know they are booked right now. The couple stormed out angry without even accepting her business card that she tried to give them. The big group understood  left quietly  and didn't make a scene about it. My friend requested all female masseuses  but I stood up and said.. excuse me.. I would like a strong man. The front desk lady  Dina.. my two friends turned around and go whoa okay... not me. Dina knodded her head and said okay.. okay.. she wants a strong man. Usually even though I request this  I don't get a strong masseuse. Dina gave me what I asked for. \\n\\nThey are quite punctual with time and Dina asked if we are ready yet. Even though one in my party was only a few minutes late. She asked us if we can go in first and she will let my friend in when she arrives. \\n\\nThere are about twelve seats in one big room  dim lights  and relaxing music playing. If you have sensitive skin and don't want any lotion on your face... let the masseuse know before you start. You begin with putting your feet in warm water  then you lay on your back on a comfy chair/table. My masseuse  Frank started on my forehead and worked his way down to my neck. Then at my mid back.. lifting it up with his fingers and lowering at each section as he moved up to my neck. Then my arms and fingers. At one point after massaging my hands  he punches the palms of my hand like we're sparring  but I don't have any gloves on. In my mind  I'm like WoW... and held in my laugh  but shined a smirk of being hit like that. He wasn't being easy on me and Dina must have told him I wanted a strong man :P Good lord was he!?!? After that  he went down to my feet. Wrapped one up in a towel and went to town on the other. Pain... oh the pain!!! With his knuckle  he slowly pierced through the bottom of my feet and rolled his knuckle down. I seriously wanted to scream. Felt like Fire... but I clenched my teeth and distracted the pain by fond memories that always brings me to a happy place. I did this throughout my entire massage session. Once he moves to a different section  what a relief!!! Pain then pleasure.. then it's pleasure and then again.. Pain. Ooooh it hurts so bad  but feels so good!!! Then with his knees in between my legs  he massages my thighs and calves. Even massaged my glutes! If you don't like to be touched period.. this might not be the place for you. He literally stretches the heck out of every part of my body. He then asks me to flip over and he works his forearm on my back. Then stretches my arms. Punches my back and wah laa!!! I'm a new woman. I sat up and both my friends started laughing crazy at me. My hair apparently resembled a lion and strands were sticking out high as the sky. All good.. that's when you know you had a great massage! :) \\n\\nGreat deal and service. Tip double for their hard work  they deserve it. Convenient place to stop by after a hectic night at work  but call first and make an appointment or they might very well be booked up. My friend went yesterday and was amazed by their massage  so she went back Again with us tonight! Definitely returning for more pain.. sooner than later.",

I must first say that the service was impeccable. Our waitress  despite my many questions and requests to leave ingredients out of my dishes  was personable  helpful  and attentive. \\n\\nI had a small plate (the meatballs with tomato sauce  basil  parmesan cheese  and polenta) and a side dish (roasted root vegetables and squash  without the farmer's cheese that normally accompanies this item). Both were delicious  albeit rich. The small plates were very generous in size  which I love  because it enables sharing. I also thought that the complementary cheddar and black pepper (?) biscuits were amazingly tasty. My friends raved about the cocktails  and I was impressed when the waitress told us that all of their cocktails have no added sugars or preservatives.\\n\\nThe desserts are especially worthy of mention. Although somewhat pricey at $9 each  they were absolutely wonderful. We had the sundae  which had some sort of bacon brittle  peanut butter cup pieces  ice cream  caramelized bananas  and peanuts. It was so good  I was practically licking the bowl. The combination of textures  plus saltiness combined with sweetness  was perfect. We also had the cinnamon sugar doughnuts with a dark chocolate dipping sauce  which was a HUGE portion and SO yummy. The doughnut holes were steaming hot and just chewy enough. We couldn't finish those suckers  there were so many!\\n\\nAlso  I paid $30 total  including tax and tip (one small plate  one side  two desserts split with 3 other people). I thought that was impressively reasonable for the high quality of the food and the service. I would go back!",

Very trendy decor  but the dining experience just does not delivery. Chef Malarkey roamed the dining room promoting the Taste  but he would have better served his restaurant had he spent the evening in the kitchen.  The entire dining experience was rushed -- we were in and out for dinner in little more than and hour.  The eggs and bacon small plate was cold  which was sad because the flavors were promising. The chicken and waffles and franks small plate was also cold.  The filet was underwhelming.  The short rib small plate was redeeming. The duck fat fries were greasy and  again  cold. The brussel sprouts were  well  burnt  (not caramelized) and doused in vinegar.  It is disappointing that a meal that was so rushed  was served cold. The server was also not interested in our comments about dinner  disappointed we opted not to order dessert.  We will choose to dine elsewhere and skip the hype of Searsucker.",

Cool design  innovative  comfortable (if you overlook the AC running at 65 F).\\n\\nShort and poor selection of wines  the menu doesn't make sense  the deserts are poor executed  service barely OK and all of this with a way overpriced tag.\\n\\nCheese bread at the beginning was good  probably the best executed dish (puzzle face).\\n\\nI had a glass of a French wine which had one of the most awkward wine tastes I've ever tried  but again  the selection is not that great.\\n\\nIn their web they have a beet salad but I didn't find it in the menu. It seems that they replaced the beets for strawberries. When I asked why  apparently beets are out of season. (Really? I'm not a farmer  but I had beets last weekend in another restaurant  oh well). Salad was barely average.\\n\\nThen I had the marrow bone. It was OK  I was expecting a little more of a flavor from the onion jam and the bread used was kind of boring for such a dish.\\n\\nFor desert I had the rum and coke. It should be called sweet bread. No taste of rum or coke what so ever. Just a spongy bread super sweet with whipped cream on the side with an unknown flavor and a jelly with a hint of lime.\\n\\nI also tried the doughnuts with chocolate.

I will admit that my fondness for Top Chef and the adorable Brian Malarkey was the first reason why I wanted to eat at this new Scottsdale restaurant  but the food and ambiance will be why I go back again. \\nThe restaurant is tucked off Camelback road and Fashion Square Mall and has these funky looking animal statues outside. Hey  I guess you gotta do what you can to get people to notice you  right?\\nThe staff was very friendly and welcoming to us. There was a DJ in the bar area and many people enjoying happy hour. The dining room was pretty dead  but it is July in Phoenix and that can be expected of many restaurants. The restaurant was very big  much bigger than I anticipated. The ambiance was casual and sexy at the same time. \\nI started off with a La Primavera cocktail and it was delicious  but not remarkable. My husband ordered a red wine suggested by our server. It was very good. Of course my husband will always Google a wine on his phone if he likes it so he can compare prices. I guess it was overly priced per glass vs what you could get the wine by the bottle in a retail outlet. Oh well  that is Scottsdale.\\nWe started off with the Smalls: Pork belly \\\"\"\"\"bacon\\\"\"\"\" + 63 degree egg. It was not only gorgeous in presentation  but really tasty! Kinda like breakfast for dinner. \\nNext up  we split the \\\"\"\"\"Cobb\\\"\"\"\" salad. Oh. My. Gosh. I know it is just a salad  but it was amazing. The blue cheese vinaigrette was amazing. The flavors of the toppings were incredible with every bite.\\nI'm crazy about veggie sides  so I almost ordered all of them with dinner so I could take a few bites of each  but we decided to just do 4. They were the bacon grits  the cauliflower  brussels sprouts  and chorizo with \\\"\"\"\"corn off the cob.\\\"\"\"\" The sides were ok. Nothing that wowed me. The brussels were overly salty and I couldn't taste any of the flavor of the other veggie sides because there was so much extra stuff involved in them. But I'm glad I tried them and now know. Luckily  my chicken entree was fantastic. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked over a bead of bulgar and sweetbreads (I don't know where the sweetbreads were unless they were mixed in really well with the bulgar ) but they were fantastic. Loved this dish and would order it again.\\nFor dessert we split a sundae  I can't remember the name of it  but it was clever. And it was really good. A sweet ending to a great evening.  I can't wait to go back...maybe with a group of friends. It seems like a great place to go for big girls night out.\"",

We saw a Groupon and decided to try it right away. If you haven't been  it is in an odd location in the edge of the mall. You have to mark at Neman Marcus or pay $5 to valet. In our opinion  if you don't have a parking lot for your restaurant  you shouldn't charge for valet  or at least validate. Also  I must admit the statues of animals out front are not our taste  but that didn't stop us from being opened minded about the food. \\n\\nThat being said  the first thing we tried was the cheese bread they give you before you order. We thought it was overly spicy and not very good. We hoped the tapas would be better.\\n\\nWe decided to go with a few different tapas. We tried:\\n1. Meatballs - These were the best thing we tried. They are homemade meatballs in a tomato basil sauce. They are very nice  but they only give you 5 small meatballs in an order.\\n2. Tuna Poke - This wasn't horrible  but it wasn't good. It also wasn't tuna poke. It was more  like a tuna tartare that looked like cat food. It wasn't fishy or anything seriously wrong with it  but there was nothing that stood out about it either. I've had it better at many other places. \\n3. Duck Fat Fries - These were very heavy and not very good. You could taste the duck fat and it was overwhelming. We've had these at other places and enjoyed them much better. The tomato jam that came with it was sort of pretentious and not very enjoyable. I would have rather had ketchup.\\n4. Cobb Salad - This was by far the worst thing we ordered. The dressing was some sort of cross between ranch and blue cheese and was super watery. Gross. The bacon came in the biggest pieces I've ever seen and basically took over the whole salad. The avocado wasn't fresh and it just left much to be desired. I could have had a better cobb salad from the Cheesecake Factory. \\n5. Scallop - The scallop was cooked perfect  but the sauce was too sweet and overwhelmed the taste of the scallop. If you like that sweet asian sauce on your scallops  then this was good  but it was too much for us. \\n\\nI'd say the food here was very average at best. The reason I didn't not give Searsucker 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the prices. Everything is extremely expensive and for it just being OK  it is just not worth it.

It's a farm to table restaurant so the ingredients are all extremely fresh  with many herbs being grown on site.\\n\\nWe arrived late on a Friday night and the first thing we noticed: It was loud - there was a DJ in the bar that you could hear very well from behind several brick walls.. But as it's the first week  I'm sure they realize the issue and we'll be the only ones fortunate enough to experience that. That being said  our plans of sitting in the bar fell through for hopes of saving our heads and ears from damage  so we opted to sit in the restaurant. The restaurant space is cozy  tons of exposed brick and a large wine rack on display with perfectly sized tables for both casual and intimate conversation. For being so new  the service was excellent.\\n\\nThere are two distinct menus  and options from one are not available at the other. First  we decided on drinks - forgoing the wine menu in favor of cocktails - the Ultra L and Banana & Basil(Unfortunately the Cream Soda wasn't quite worked out yet). The Ultra L($9) was extremely delicious - mint  chocolate  and lemon all combined in a smooth and creamy drink. The banana and basil($8) tasted like a banana popsicle  but not quite as sweet. \\n\\nI was excited for the food to arrive  I was just talking to someone about how I had always wanted to try Alla Famiglia and here was a production by the same owners. For our meal we decided to split two menu items - the Caprese salad with fresh-in-house-pulled mozzarella($13) and mushroom risotto sans snails(They were very accommodating to vegetarianism: $15 - $18 w/ snails). The Caprese was ultra-fresh  with heirloom tomatoes  balsamic  olives  and super fresh basil. The risotto had a strong earthy flavor  perfect tenderness  and a delicious hint of black pepper. As someone who doesn't eat mushrooms  I was happy to eat a ton of this dish.\\n\\nI'm not typically one to get dessert  but the waitress was able to tempt us with a mascarpone cheesecake with peach coulis and a graham cracker crust  and I'm glad she did. This dessert was absolutely fantastic  light(for cheesecake) and the peach coulis added the perfect balance to the dish. Definitely one of the highest points of the meal.\\n\\nAfter dessert we got a glass of wine($9) and another cocktail  the Cocoa Powder($9) - which tasted like a mexican hot chocolate with a ton of cayenne thrown in. This drink was extremely spicy  so look out  but it was never unpleasant. That being said  I really enjoy and eat a lot of spicy food  so your mileage my vary.\\n\\nWe were checked on by the bartender and chefs and we thanked them for the wonderful meal. They let us know that in the future there will be two more sections to the restaurant: A beautiful lounge/dance bar upstairs with world-inspired shots instead of cocktails and a beach patio in the back. \\n\\nAll in all I'm extremely excited to have this new option in the Strip. For a nice Italian dinner(Something I don't usually go with) or a trendy bar  definitely make sure Emilia Romagna is on your radar - especially before there is a line around the block to get in.",

If it was even the slightest bit busy  I'd understand. Trust me  it wasn't.\\n \\nI gave them another chance.  After a friend ordered something that was nothing like she thought it would be the server said she couldn't take it off. We asked to talk to the owner  and the server said  \\\"\"\"\"are you sure? She's in a terrible mood\\\"\"\"\". The owner refused to take it off the bill saying \\\"\"\"\"this isn't a tasting menu\\\"\"\"\". That $8 roll was that important compared to our $200 tab.  She then proceeded to tell us to \\\"\"\"\"f*ck off\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nFor some asinine reason  a year later we return to give it another shot. The server was very nice. Towards the end of our stay  we saw the owner loudly talking to another customer  and pointing at us. We became very uncomfortable  so we left. As we were leaving  a host came running out. In a very sarcastic and obnoxious tone said  \\\"\"\"\"HAVE A GREAT NIGHT\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nHow this place is still in business is amazing. This is NOT how you treat paying customers. I know the owner has multiple restaurants around the valley.  SHE alone is destroying such an awesome concept. Don't be in this business if you hate it.\"",

After walking 3 km to get to Chez Boris  I was excited to try what I thought would be an unforgettable donut.\\n\\nSadly  the freshly made cinnamon and sugar donuts they offer are forgettable. I've made better donuts at home  myself. The cafe filtre I had with my fresh donuts was a little disappointing.\\n\\nI brought some of the special flavors home to try for breakfast tomorrow (one flavor is double chocolate  the other is lime + juniper) simply because I took the trouble to walk  a half hour there and did not want to leave empty handed. When I tried them the next morning  the chocolate was okay  though the lime + juniper tasted like a gin and tonic  and it was not very moist; almost too dry to eat.\\n\\nIf you're in the area  it's worth checking out once. However  Chez Boris does not make a 'destination donut' worth a special trip. \\n\\nI was disappointed that on my walk home  I was able to find incredible donuts for half the price of the Chez Boris specialty donuts at a small place called Boulangerie Patisserie Nouveau Samos on St. Laurent. It doesn't look special from the outside  but their donuts are amazing and not to mention huge!",

Check-in was easy and we filled out all the normal paperwork. The woman at the front counter was busy answering the phones  making several Groupon appointments  but we weren't offered any water or the typical   'Your massage therapist will be right with you' once we turned in the paperwork. I was greeted by Dominic a short time later and led back to my room.\\n\\nThe room is typical for a day spas. The only ambiance in the room was a candle holder on the wall. There was a counter in the back and a small bench to place your clothes in the corner. The music continued to play in the room on the overhead speakers throughout the massage. It would have been nice to see a little more decoration in the room to make it feel more inviting. I'm not sure why these places don't invest a little more into decorations and give it a true spa feel. Additionally  the music overhead was okay but it would be a nice touch to be offered a different music selection if possible. Granted  this is all wishful thinking and above and beyond what you typically see in a day spa but it would have put this place over the top because my massage was fantastic!\\n\\nDominic asked if there way anything I needed extra attention on before starting and he did an excellent job of massaging just the right places. I've had several massages before but I would say this is definitely one of my top. Maybe it was because of his technique (long  slow movements) but it definitely was something I enjoyed very much.

Once on the bed  the therapist did not care to ask me what my pressure preference was  assuming she read that paperwork  but after a couple of minutes and still nothing deep like I hoped for  I had to tell her not only once  but twice during my massage that I wanted more therapeutic and deep tissue. Half hour or so into it I just could not stop thinking just how horrible this massage was and how badly I just wanted to walk out considering this was not helping with the relaxation I was seeking for  but just now making me more anxious than I was beforehand.

Nothing was achieved from my session. 1 week earlier I had a session at a different Colonics place and it was a wonderful experience that had great results. After an hour of what can only be described as one of the most awkward and uncomfortable experiences I've had  I was told that I owed $12 as a tip  even though this was a Groupon gift. I understand you should tip your therapist  however  a tip is based on the experience  and I didn't feel a tip was warranted. This upset the rude lady behind counter who made it a point to show me the small sign in the lobby stating that tips are necessary. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go here.\"",

Time to remedy that.\\n\\nAs a vegetarian  I am used to being under-considered.  In fact  I often tell people \\\"\"\"\"I'm a vegetarian- how good can food ever be?\\\"\"\"\" when they ask me how my meal at a restaurant is.  I love being a vegetarian  and I love the food I cook myself  but I am most often missing that foodgasm so often that I sit and watch my friends having at a restaurant.  This is not the case at Sochu House.  The man knows how to cook for carnivores AND vegetarians alike  equally as skillfully.  In fact  I'd go so far as to say his tofu is excellent  the best I've ever had.\\n\\nWe've been to the restaurant and ordered takeout many times  and both are top notch.  The restaurant has a cool  sexy downtown vibe  a great bar  and a great atmosphere.  Service has always been good when we've been there.  When we get takeout  they take the time to package the food in such a way that things that are crispy stay crispy  things that are fresh stay fresh  and things that are hot liquid stay in their containers.  This is far too rare at most restaurants.\\n\\nI have eaten many different things there  all excellent  and I've seen others order many other things there both vegetarian and non-vegetarian  and I have NEVER seen a diner unhappy with their meal.  Never.  My absolute favorite is the hot and sour soup.  It is the best I've had in my entire life  and I'm a hot and sour soup long-time fan.  It has so many lovely chunks in there- pineapples  jalepenos  delightful noodles  mushrooms  tofu  and things I don't have any clue about and frankly don't care because it is delicious.\\n\\nThank you Johnny- don't leave downtown for good PLEASE!!!\"",

The mattress was on just a bed frame (no bed skirt even hiding the mattress). The T.V. was a tube. There was yellow stains in the bathtub. It was horrid! My husband talked to the front desk and they explained that the pictures that were advertised were their deluxe rooms and we paid for a standard. Luckily  he said he'd refund us our money if Expedia gave us the OK (which they did and booked at a much nicer place). We grabbed our stuff and left as fast as we could.

We came here on a Friday night and shared two dishes - we ordered the chicken burrito and 2 chorizo tacos.  We also ordered the guacamole.  The chorizo tacos were very good - chorizo can be greasy  but these were not.  Great flavor with fresh avocado and cilantro.  The burrito was very good too - the shredded chicken was super moist.  The guacamole was also very good - but the chips seemed like they were not so fresh.  They actually weren't even chips - they were full sized tortillas which you broke up to use as chips.  Also there was no salsa?  That was a bit odd - I know chips and salsa are a HUGE reason I go for Mexican food - they are my guilty pleasure.  I'll definitely be back though.",

They wanted to pull between 6-10 teeth on my cats each!  That was going to be thousands of dollars and I thought it was really extreme because 2 years ago I took them and the doctor who started the clinic said they were fine.  The new doctor who has since taken over was the aggresive one.  Dr. Gilchrist said he didn't even see tarter on one of mine (8 and 7yrs respectively) and the other was just a little.

The fact that he can run free and play (or climb in a lap!) all day is great!  I also really like that he's with dogs of all sizes and not separated into groups based on size like so many other facilities.

This was worse than when I had first taken the car to be repaired (at time of initial repair transmission Functioned fine just made noise). I took car to another shop after this one refused to fix it for free or for a reduced cost. The second shop said a bearing had gone out likely because it was packed too tight by this shop (2b transmission). 2b did a poor job rebuilding the transmission if they even rebuilt it.

This ended the deal.  Recommend that any pre-owned vehicle considered for purchase be seen by your own mechanic.\\n\\n The finance person was all smiles until we declined an extended warranty on the auto with the \\\"\"\"\"fixable\\\"\"\"\" defect.  The loan through this dealer was 1% higher than the other dealership where we finally purchased a vehicle.  So  check with your bank or credit union before negotiating a loan.\\n \\n Their web site is easy to navigate but not always accurate.  One car which has been sold has been on the site for over three weeks.  Earlier in my search  I contacted the sales staff to set up an appointment to test drive this car.  When I arrived I was shown a different car.  The car fax report would not open on the site for this auto; perhaps that was a clue as to the true status of the vehicle. Latter I was told that the car I requested had sold and that their internet staff was over extended and unable to update the site at times.  Oddly enough  other vehicles are posted and removed in a timely manner.\\n\\n Ultimately we went to another Infiniti dealership for far better treatment.  At this dealership  the final price was agreed and no additional fees were added.  The financial officer was kind and did not try to bully us or imply that we were stupid for not buying an extended warranty.  The finance department was able to offer the same loan rate as our credit union.  Overall the experience was less stressful and more straight forward than that experienced at Park Place Infiniti.\"",

Beware of large brunch crowds. \\n\\nThe food alone was wonderful. The meals were perfection and prepared with the slightest simple yet effective touch. What really drew me to the place was the flight of cold brew  what a genius idea!! We ordered a mexican benedict and a BOMC. The benedict was exactly what I expected  its presentation was great and the chorizo definitely gave off it's mexican flavor. The BOMC was spectacular. The portion is enough for two and easily one of my favorite dishes  even though I haven't tried anything else.....it was just that good. The pork chop was tender and wasn't too seasoned so the pork flavor alone was enlightening. The waffle was a perfect sweetness and my eggs were as good as scrambled eggs can be. The portuguese donut it was paired with was cute  light and powdered with sugar. I didn't have much of it because I was already extremely full from the dish  which was bittersweet. I had a iced latte with vanilla and it was great  smooth and sweet. We also had the flight which will get you to that coffee high. I can't remember the names of the brews but the jalape\\u00f1o one was interesting  though wouldn't be my first choice.\\n\\nI would recommend the restaurant to any breakfast or coffee aficionado.

I have called about 5 times to complain that I am only getting 5mb per second on all my devices. Every time I call  the person on the other end tells me that the service looks great on their end. They don't listen when I tell them that I am getting 5Mb on 3 devices and I should not have to reset the modem every two days like they tell me too. \\nNo one listens to what I need and it is a bunch of lies. Today  I called to cancel and Ginger (the rep) told me that I have a 12 month commitment. Mind you that I signed up for a no-contract service. She said that I owe $20 per month for the unused months (8 months left). She said that I could only cancel within the first 30 days. I let her know that I have called 5 times about the bad service. She cannot see the notes on her end and she is not linked to notes from technical issues. How can someone in retention not be able to see the history of the account to be able to get the full picture. \\nAnother lie and ploy to get you to sign up and make you pay even more when you want to cancel. \\nI don't want much  I just want my devices to have more than 5Mb per second. I asked to speak to a supervisor and Ginger refused to transfer me. She said she can send an email and then hung up on me. Yes  she hung up on me. That is CenturyLink in a nutshell. Pull this call  9/26/2014 at about 2:10pm and the rep name is Ginger. All I want is to leave. I don't want to do business with your company because you are shady and crooked. You cannot do business like this in 2014 and I will let every last human know to stay away. You cannot put NO CONTRACT on the front page of your website and then tell me I am in a 12 month \\\"\"\"\"commitment\\\"\"\"\". \\nPlease make it right. Not only for me but for future customers. \\n1. Ginger cannot hang up on me even though I am an angry customer. I believe I called the retention number. Not only does she not help resolve an issue I have been having for months  she hangs up on me. She should be repremanded\\n2.  Change the wording on your website to either say 12 month contract or truly allow customer to cancel anytime under your no contract. No Contract- Is a lie. it is not called a contract but it is a 12 month commitment. (how funny does that sound and is it different to you and I). I called to cancel and I will have to pay  $20 per month for the unused months left in my \\\"\"\"\"commitment\\\"\"\"\"\\n2. They throttle your service. You do not have the speed that you pay for. They will slow you down to a crawl if you use your service. \\n3. The modem is the cheapest. When I signed up I was told that I had to use their modem/WIFI. If you use any devices wirelessly  stay away from Centurylink. I sold my $200 WIFI with the latest technology to go with their $39 one.  The jokes on me.\\n4. You will not get the service you pay for and complaining will do absolutelynothing. Don't be sold on the price they give you.\\n\\nAgain  I just want to leave  I am unhappy because I pay for a service that I am not getting. All I ask is for you to honor we initially agreed upon. NO CONTRACT. It is simple  COX does it  Time Warner does too. When the customer does not want the service  we just part ways.\"",

The girls at the front desk are busy gossiping so we decide to at least look around a bit and that's when one of the girls approaches us with a confused look on her face \\\"\"\"\"Um..

We select dresses to try on and are directed to the fitting room/seating area. \\n\\nMy sister emerges from the fitting room in her first dress and the associate takes off; no questions about the dress or anything... back to the front to gossip.

The girl on the phone told me I could come in and try these on.\\\"\"\"\" The associate then rudely told the girl that she couldn't just try on dresses without an associate's help and that she would have to come back in 2 hours if she wanted to try anything on. The girl  who was about in tears and mortified  repeated her situation and that she was told she was allowed to try on dresses.

However  I think it's a nice surprise of a place you wouldn't expect.\\nOne last thing  the girl working the bar (O'Aces) was really nice too. She backed up the restaurant side by promoting them and getting the waitress out to us as soon as we were ready. Good conversation and attentive.\"",

Lets just say that this place has some good music but the service is HORRIBLE! and 80% of the people didn't speak English. On Fridays is mostly for Hispanic crowd and they definitely know how to make you feel unwelcome if you are not hispanic. The waiters literally ignored me for 40 mins while waiting for a drink and gladly served other Hispanic customers that came way after me to buy drinks while standing next to me.  I had to give a customer money to buy a drink for me at the same bar. Even worst is the water down the drinks...and to get the best of of it  you will have to buy either a shot or a beer. And not to mention the amount of police/security outside waiting for something to happen.

While I tend to focus on places in the Plateau and Mile End districts (mostly because I live nearby which is convenient on lazy weekends)  every once in a while I will hear of a place for which I am willing to go a little further. Jason from Shut Up and Eat provided me with this gem with one of his most recent posts. As such  I hightailed it to NDG with my brunch buddy to go visit Prohibition.\\n\\nThis small restaurant sticks to a one page focused menu that has eclectic brunch fare. I started with the triple chocolate pretzel cookie because....well why not? Rich and gooey  just a delicious cookie. The pretzel pieces were not as plentiful as I expected but the mix of chocolates offset that nicely.\\n\\nMy friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and sugar bacon. The pancakes were nice and fluffy with a very strong note of lemon. I didn't expect the lemon to come out that strongly in the batter. Truly a pleasant surprise. The blueberry compote added the right level of sweetness to the dishes - maple syrup not required but still utilized. The sugar bacon was very nice as well - big thick cut bacon that is crispy and sweet at the same time.\\n\\nI ordered the Challah french toast and fried chicken combo. A wonderful play on the southern classic chicken and waffles. The Challah french toast brought forth a wonderful sweet and crisp exterior with a light and fluffy interior. Honestly one of the French toast plates I've ever had. The fried chicken was very well done as well. Two requirements come to mind with fried chicken. First  the batter must be seasoned properly and crispy. Second  the chicken must remain juicy. Dryness is not an option. Both requirements were nailed here. This was very good chicken which a nice balance to the sweetness of the French toast. It is a pretty heavy dish by the usual breakfast and brunch standard  so if you like a lighter meal  avoid this combo but for everyone else  you will love it.\\n\\nProhibition certainly brought to the table some great brunch dishes that veered away from the standard breakfast and brunch fare. The price is reasonable all things considered and unlike a lot of places nowadays  the coffee and tea is included in the meal. If you are a party larger than 2  you may end up waiting in weekends as the place is not very big but regardless  Prohibition is certainly worth a look for any brunch seeking individuals.\\n\\nCheers!",

Usually  the fried chicken  if available  is the top attraction  due to its crispyness and moist meat. On this day  which was a Monday afternoon  I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering. Nothing else actually looked or tasted good. Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough  that is why I purchased the buffet. Too bad  that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out. Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease. Mongolian BBQ was also tried  but they don't put any sauce on it when they cook it  so it tastes just like  well nothing. The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and didn't taste much better either. Deserts needed some work as well  but the butter pecan custard (they said it was) was decent  although could have been the culprit also to my later problems. You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something (like some corn  etc) he is all over it  taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up. I'm all for a clean buffet  but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon. Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat. Call ahead and if the fried  chicken is available for dinner  it is worth the $8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch  which would include potatoes.

As there were probably 25 people working  it wasn't hard to find somebody to ask.

They're milking Mill Ave. for all it's worth  that's for sure  and pandering to the university crowd with HALF OFF drafts for university students  faculty and staff on Wednesdays. \\nAll you public sheeple have to get a Loyalty Card or show up for happy hour for any sort of discount  which is definitely LESS than half off.\\nMakes me want to get a student ID again (I graduated with a B.Sc. in the 90's  thank you very much) so I can have my ass kissed by everyone who wants my money rather than be the ass kisser of places who think they're doing me a favor by being there.\\n \\nW.O.B. is a sports bar with good beer and NO FOOD  but I understand they partnered with a few local places that will deliver in. The place is small and I fully expect it to be packed with university rookies when school starts. I'm not looking forward to this. I hate zoos and so do the local beer snobs.\\n\\nSure the place has lots of great beers but the atmosphere is cow-herdy and loud   and you should take advantage of price breaks whenever possible or get ready to feel regretful. \\nIf it's crowded  JUST WALK BACK OUT. Good luck getting a seat  and squeezing in and ordering is a royal pain.\\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"Nobody goes there  it's too crowded.\\\"\"\"\"  -- Yogi Berra\\n\\nIf you plan to go at all  go early happy hour then split when the ant farm comes in.\\n\\nHowever I'm glad for its presence because it's contributing to beer consciousness and the growth of the craft beer industry by showing people there's more to beer than fizzy yellow rat piss. \\n\\nBottom line is I won't be a regular here  I might stop in for some tap takeovers or other promo events  but I refuse to pay full price when I can drink incredible beers for much less elsewhere. No I'm not telling you where. \\n\\nHOWEVER there's a place that can handle ANY crowd with speed and efficiency  has plenty of seating  friendly staff that has time to talk to you  has incredible beers on tap and in the fridge  AND IN-HOUSE food with pizzas to die for  and that is PAPAGO BREWING in south Scottsdale at McDowell and Scottsdale Rd in the plaza next to the Mandarin Buffet.\\nHave fun  getting annoyed at W.O.B.  sheeple!\\nOr head to PAPAGO where they keep it real.\"",

I enjoyed every  single  mouthful. \\n\\nA note as well - I'm on a diet. Almond croissants are pretty much verboten. The SR is on a diet. He is sick with jealousy at my hedonism...

It's sweet  not hot & sour like I'm accustomed to.  The salads come out & I pick out 4 wilted pieces of lettuce.  There is hardly any peanut dressing on it.  The eggrolls are nothing special & could pass for frozen.  There is little to no dipping sauce for them.\\n\\nMy \\\"\"\"\"Spicy\\\"\"\"\" Basil dish is lacking in spice & basil.  It would've been more appropriate to call it Salty Beef with 2 Basil Leaves.  It was fairly oily  I chalk that up to low quality ground beef being utilized.  I had to ask for hot sauce/chili flakes as the spice level was more like a 1/2-1...not 3.  This was the blandest (minus the salt) example of the dish I've had anywhere.\\n\\nHer Sweet & Sour Chicken on the other hand is more like a Spicy & Sour Chicken...lot's of heat.  Too much for her actually.  She wasn't able to finish it due to it being spicier than what she is comfortable with.  Maybe the chef got our 2s & 3s mixed up?\\n\\nAlso  their website which is linked on yelp apparently isn't theirs (anymore).  They won't honor some things on it such as a Thai Coffee or Thai Ice tea coming with your lunch special for $1 more.  There is a 10% discount if you pay with cash.  I had none  so I payed with a debit card.  When the waitress returned with the bill & my card  she neglected to give me a pen...a great way to end our lunch.\\n\\nLooks like this place has had a name change as well as management change in the last 6 months alone.  They need to change the quality of the food if they want to stick around.\"",

Consequently  I returned and later bought another groupon when they came out in July.  However  the next trip was a complete 180.  I spent about $70 on food and drink for my daughter and myself.  When ready to leave  I presented the Groupon to our waiter (different waiter  older  some sort of accent).  Evidently he pushed the \\\"\"\"\"redeem\\\"\"\"\" button because he handed the phone back to me with the message  \\\"\"\"\" Are you certain you want to redeem this Groupon.\\\"\"\"\"  And  told me there was something wrong with my phone.  I explained it was just prompting us to redeem the Groupon.  He seemed confused  so  I pressed  \\\"\"\"\"Yes.\\\"\"\"\"  Unfortunately  he had apparently not written the code down.  Consequently  he told me I could not use the Groupon and accused me  in front of all the other customers  of trying to rip him off by using an expired Groupon.  I was livid because no matter how I or my daughter tried to explain it to him  he would not listen.  I asked to speak with the manager.  However  he told me he was the owner.  At that point  we left and I informed him I would never return.  After we got home  my daughter  still very upset  called to speak with him.  He continued to refuse to listen and offered no solution.  All of this nonsense over a Groupon that would have cost the business $10  since they had already received the $10 I spent on it.  \\n\\nAs it turned out  he was not the owner.  The owner called my daughter the next day and apologized  stating that she would make it right.  She suggested I stop payment on the transaction.  However  I was told by the bank that debit transactions cannot be stopped.  I relayed this message to the owner  but have never received a response.  So   I can only assume that she has no intention of making it right  either   I can't believe any concerned business owner would let an employee  treat customers that way and not make it right.  Bon Chef has lost my family's business and I will not hesitate to inform everyone who asks me about the cafe what my last experience was like.  Bon Chef  \\\"\"\"\"Shame on you!\\\"",

I am supposed to pay as for a cash visit and they still try to charge me only my copy every time  which could cause trouble with my insurance company. The staff isn't organized at all. They couldn't even find the sign in sheet. All of your measurements are written down on sticky notes  which I'm assuming isn't always transferred where intended considering that the woman who was weighing me asked me what my weight was at the time of my last visit. They are friendly for the most part but that's not all it takes to run a doctor's office. The professionalism just isn't there.\\n\\nDr. Adams herself is awesome  which is the only reason I gave 2 stars. She is a busy doctor with lots of patients but still makes you feel remembered and spends time talking with you until any and all questions have been answered. I intend to continue to see her but it sure would be nice if the staff worked on their organization and professional skills.",

Eventually  they opened a few in Michigan  and I would eat there when I could.  \\n\\nFast forward a few years  and now I live in Phoenix. Not a potbelly in sight  so I ate at other sub shops. Now don't get me wrong  Phoenix does have a good selection of sub places to eat at  and I am a fan of a few local places out here. But  when I heard that they were opening a Potbellies  I could not have been any more excited! FINALLY!\\n\\nSo this place opened last week  and the foot traffic in and out of this place has been tremendous!  Move over other sub shops  this place is here to stay. Potbelly's makes a hell of a sub  and I  along with many others  are dedicated fans of this place. I went on the second day they opened  and got me a roast beef sub. Today? I got the stack without the ham.\\n\\nPotbelly's has a great menu selection to choose from  with extremely wonderful prices.  They also list the calorie count for you right on the menu  so you know just how healthy (or unhealthy) the sub will be.  They even have a vegetarian sub for all you non meat eaters! Also they have great deserts here  all fresh baked. Cookies and brownies freshly made  along with smoothies and shakes as well.  These are some serious people here folks!\\n\\nThe menu here is ample  with plenty to choose from  but it's not as big as I remember it from the Chicago and Detroit locations.  The gal told me that they have a limited menu now since they just opened  and will be adding on in the future with the rest of the items that they normally offer.\\n\\nService here is surprisingly efficient  with plenty of staff to help you out. The line may be long  but it moves quickly  so don't be intimidated when you arrive.  I'm in and out in 5 minutes!  They have plenty of seating indoors and out  but if you come during lunch hour like I do  you might have a problem finding a seat. Since I work right here  I just take the sub back with me to my desk and eat.\\n\\nGo eat some Potbellies. Best subs around  and you'll be a fan of this place in no time!",

I should start off by saying that I am not a fan of McGrath - personality wise but  I did (once upon a time) like his food.  Also since I live in far N.S its nice to have options in the area.  We decided to give this place a try last night and what a huge disappointment.\\n\\nWe arrived early for our reservations and were seated directly  the bus boy was very quick with the water - good.\\n\\nWaitress was m.i.a for what seemed sometime - maybe she wasn't told that she had a table.  But  once she appeared all was good.\\n\\nFood...not so good.  The signature pork chile seemed bland (not what I remember it to be) but  good enough.  2 entr\\u00e9es  the pork rack and the short ribs.\\n\\nThe short ribs are absolutely drenched in a Dr. Pepper sauce.  They were moist but  I couldn't taste much beyond that sauce even when I managed to wipe it off the meat.  Overwhelming!  The chile risotto  not cooked properly.  Not al dente simply not cooked.  Also room temperature and absolutely no flavor  despite the fact that I added salt and pepper still no flavor.  The dish did come with a little frisee salad with I believe marinated red onions  this was nice - wish I had more of that on my plate!\\n\\nThe pork rack better than the short ribs but  again no flavor.  The restaurants signature and concept is based around the Wood-Fired Rotisserie  one would think this would impart a ton of aroma and  flavor but  no  nothing.  Again BBB and Dull!  The grits might as well have been cooked in nothing but water.\\n\\nSide - Super Greens  Kale  Bacon  Red Onion  Cider Vinegar - OK there is nothing I love more than kale in any variety and any preparation  I simply love it but  this was the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life.  The kale was tough and had an extremely gamy taste... I couldn't stomach more than two bites then had to send it back.  \\n\\nSomeone did come out to inquire about the kale and offered us another side dish which we declined.  \\n\\nThe service turned out to be very good and we were also offered complimentary desserts which we also declined - at that point we were no longer interested in seeing more from the kitchen.  \\n\\nI'm not sure whats going on in the kitchen but  clearly flavor is not on the agenda - is anyone tasting this food?   At this rate this may go the way of its predecessors - out of business.\\n\\nSo $100+ later and I wished we had just gone across to Grimaldi's for pizza!",

        "text": "\"While on business in Las Vegas  I tapped into my network of friends and locals to recommend a new place to eat.  I have my regular spots that I enjoy but this time I wanted something a little different yet close to my hotel  Red Rock.  A few of them actually recommended that I try 808 Tapas in the Summerlin area  which recently opened for business.  \\n\\n808 Tapas appears to bill itself as an infusion of east & west and sake lounge.  The restaurant was quite easy to find given that its sign stood out among the neighboring businesses.  Upon entering  I was greeted with a warm \\\"\"\"\"ALOHA\\\"\"\"\" by the staff  which was expected since 808 is the area code for the Hawaiian Islands.  From what my friends told me  I should expect Asian/Hawaiian influence fusion style dishes at a reasonable price range.\\n\\nMy business associate and I started with the Tensai Hamachi Shooters.  This dish caught my as I'm quite the fan of the hamachi shooters served at Michelin Star Alexander's in Cupertino. The hamachi flesh literally melted away in my mouth and the chef did an excellent job to find the perfect balance with the use of white truffle oil with the ponzu sauce.  It is $3 each or $15 for 6.  We opted for the half dozen. This dish is highly recommended!\\n\\nWe then ordered the Crab Stack Salad at the recommendation of our server.  You will love the way this dish is presented in a stack and then our server began mixing and tossing it table side before we anxiously dug in.  The ginger lime dressing was so refreshing and it complimented the veggies  mango  and the snow crab. This dish was $10 and it was more than enough for two of us to enjoy. What really stood out is the ample amount of snow crab in this dish.  I much prefer this than your usual artificial crab that's served in other sushi restaurants and in your typical \\\"\"\"\"all you can eat\\\"\"\"\" joints.\\n\\nI took it upon myself to order the Uni Tempura as I am much familiar and enjoy this dish at Nobu.  Much to my surprise  this dish was served exactly like Nobu.  The only difference is it's a larger portion and plated differently.  I suspect there is some Nobu connection amongst the staff here.  If you eat uni  this dish is a must as it's a bargain in price at $10 with a much larger serving than you would get at Nobu.\\n\\nMy co-worker and I both decided to order the Fish Tacos.  The panko crusted tilapia was cooked to the perfect crisp and I absolutely enjoyed the blood orange slaw which complimented this dish well and this is definitely not your typical bland tasteless fish tacos like you get at xxxhoo's Fish Taco.  This dish was $6 for two tacos and a definite must order.\\n\\nBeing born and raised in Hawaii  the next dish caught my eye on the menu and I ordered it.  The Lomi Lomi Salmon Caprese is the 808 Tapas take of traditional caprese.  Fresh buffalo mozzarella topped with lomi lomi salmon  a traditional Hawaiian dish of salted salmon  sliced tomatoes  and diced onions drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This dish was refreshing and I believe it truly represents the 808 area code.  I must commend the chef for his creativity and thought process in the creation of this dish.  You definitely need not be from Hawaii to enjoy this dish!  This dish was $7.50.\\n\\nWe ordered the Wagyu Beef Sliders.  These sliders were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of pink.  The marinated shiitake mushrooms were TASTY and the Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo sauce was to die for.  This was one of the best burger/slider I've ever tasted!  I highly recommend this and I'll definitely be coming back just for this!  You get two sliders for $7.50 along with fresh made taro chips that are so addicting you'll be asking if you can order a bag of it for take out.\\n\\nWe were both getting a bit stuffed  but we gave in and ordered the Spicy Tuna Crackers for our last dish.  The crispy tempura nori crackers had just the right kick with wasabi and was topped with ahi tuna poke. This dish was $6.50 for five crackers and munching on these with a nice cold Kirin the next time I visit.\\n\\nWe had also ordered a pitcher of the 808 White Peach Sakeria to wash things down. It was refreshing and delicious!  It certainly opened my eyes and palate up to new creations and ways to enjoy drinking sake.\\n\\nWe didn't have room for dessert  however  the banana & apple fritters served with ice cream and fresh fruits looked absolutely mouth watering at the table next to us. I will leave room to experience this when I return next month to town for business.\\n\\nI believe this place will be a gem for the Summerlin community and will quickly fill its small capacity as word circulates amongst foodies who possess the palate to identify both quality and value.  The majority of the dishes are priced between $4 to $10.\"",

The studio also sells women and mens fitness clothes  accessories  shoes  etc. I bought some adorable/sexy Zumba tops that are very comfortable. \\n\\nOther than that  the other great thing are the owners  the instructors and the people that come there to work out. It is so laid back and everyone is having fun and happy to be there. Being that I have a gym membership and Bikram yoga pass  I often wonder how practical it is to frequent a 3rd place to work out.

These are the top two killers of children less than 5-years-old in other countries  but we don't really hear about it much. This is where CTW comes in with distributing soap and preventing more deaths. SSOO simple  so it's crazy to me that this still happens in the world outside of ourselves. \\n\\nMakes sense to have this here as we are a hospitality city and many of our strip hotels throw away hotel toiletries daily. Apparently since inception  1.2million lbs. of this has been prevented from just going into the landfils. So it saves lives  AND is a green environmental cause too. \\n\\nOur little group of Yelp rockstars sorted soap from various hotels (mostly Vegas  but this facility receives all of the West Coast) into liquids and solid soaps.  It's pretty easy so we were able to chat while doing it but you just have to be okay with standing on your feet  lifting buckets and getting soapy (though you have gloves  and masks if you're fragrance sensitive). We got to laugh at some of the odd things that made it into the bags - like a hotel roomservice plate  sewing kits  and lots of fake eyelashes stuck on bars of soap. Haaa. \\n\\nThe other CLW locations (Orlando and Toronto) are more automated with their soap making but this location is still doing a lot of things by hand so they definitely need the help! They still hand scrape the debris of the bars  hand crank to grind them  mix into sanitizing solution  bake and mold so they don't make too much soap but sort and send a lot to the mechanized factory in Orlando until they can get their own huge setup. The two employees are really chill and nice.... email them to volunteer now! \\n\\nIt's a worthy cause and will definitely go on our rotation of places to help. Look for the monthly UYE volunteer series that a few of us Yelpers are planning to commit to. This started with Yelp Helps month  but the goodness shouldn't end there.",

They were busy when my friend and I walked in  so we went back to our parking meter to put some more time on it. We walked back in and I told the young lady that my name was on the list she said just give her a second and she would seat us  which she did. Our server  who never told us her name  was apparently not in the best mood. I mean I've been working in the hospitality/serving industry pretty much my whole working career  which started at 14  and we all know  in order to make it  sometimes you have to put on a smile and Fake it. I didn't know their breakfast stopped at 11  which is my fault as a new patron  but eggs can be served all day  2 eggs anyway you would like.... does not mean anyway you would like... its ok though. i got some truffle oil egg meal that was alright  but i wanted to be healthy and i wanted breakfast and they said that they could only do scrambled eggs  not an omelet.... i couldn't even get veggies  which again  my problem for not reading more into the place but since they had gotten some really good reviews on here (yelp) I was like screw it lets go its probably awesome  which again  the food was  but not the service. When the server got to our table with our food  she asked if we needed anything else  my friend I was with just said her toast  which was sitting in the window i saw it  and i watched it sit for about 10 minutes. We also wanted to split our check at the end of our meal  which one young lady said they couldn't split it  but they could put a different amount on each card  which they did. We then received a letter in our check about splitting the check  saying they were slammed and next time only one credit card per table  Well  this place is not that big  there were 4 empty tables  I'm gonna say 5 servers and a manager there. which some were just standing around  our server who was having not the best day also moved about as slow as molasses. She also snapped her fingers at a line cook  and the restaurants I've worked at  if she would of done that to them  when were \\\"\"\"\"slammed\\\"\"\"\" they probably would of chopped her finger off. lol.... anyways  i suggest that you go there for the food  just don't expect the best service and remember ONLY ONE CREDIT CARD PER TABLE. If we pulled that at my old job in florida which is a fast pace tequila bar and Mexican restaurant  you would get fired. not trying to be snobby or anything like that and sorry if i come off that way but i feel like when I'm serving a guest or anything i usually act pretty hyped because if I'm nice and they're too \\\"\"\"\"in the biz\\\"\"\"\" I'm probably going to get tipped over twenty percent and will probably make new friends  wether I have the time or not  I always wear a smile. I don't know  maybe I'm just a people person. again though the food was EXCELLENT.\"",

The food  even despite the fact that it's a little pricey  might get 5 stars by itself. \\n\\nMy issue with eat. however  is how unwelcome I feel when I go there. I work nearby and have stopped by for lunch on a handful of occasions  never really loving the service  but my visit yesterday was the last straw. First  our table was given away after the hostess failed to step outside to call my name (the waiting area inside was full). Second  our order was never put in by the waitress and it wasn't until another server checked on us 30 minutes later that the food was finally prepared. Finally  when the food did arrive  one of our orders was wrong. At that point  we had both already gone over our allotted lunch hour  so my companion gave up and just ate what she had received. \\n\\nThe server who noticed we never got food did apologize for the issue  but the original waitress who took the order never bothered to come by to apologize. Over an hour and half after our arrival we finally paid and left. I'll probably avoid going back with co-workers in the future - I can't keep taking such long lunch breaks. And I can't justify paying so much on a lunch at a place that doesn't seem to appreciate my business.",

Asked for some suggestions  all i heard was mumbling  didn't want to help  gave us a sheet and told us to put the numbers down of the beers we wanted to try. Gave us our flights  never came over to ask us if we liked anything in particular or if we had any questions... nothing. We also ordered the Porky pizza. The concept is great but there was waaaaaaaayyyyyy to much sage on the pizza  totally overpowering. I had to dig in and take the huge pieces off so I can eat the pizza. We paid  got up  not a thank you for coming  nothing. Don't care. \\nThats fine I don't care either and I won't come back. \\nGo to Four Peaks Brewing in Tempe.

My first critique would be that the buffet is placed quite awkwardly  the lines are definitely causing traffic for people passing by.\\n\\nSecond would be the Asian food. The Chinese bbq pork  though the cuts were HUGE  was missing some authentic flavor. All I could taste was honey. Their dimsum was good  except that since they've been out for quite some time they dried up a little bit. The positive thing though is that their Pad Thai tasted great. I know some buffets have attempted featuring this dish and failed miserably. Bacchanal however  did good on this one; it had the right spice level and wasn't mushy in texture. Their sushi was okay. Definitely better than other strip buffets that offers them  yes  but not much variety either. Then again  Bacchanal is not strictly sushi so it's understandable. I've seen some curry somewhere and wanted to try them  but couldn't find a bigger bowl. Have to remind myself to try them next time. \\n\\nI enjoyed the \\\"\"\"\"American\\\"\"\"\" dishes like: scalloped potatoes  prime rib  calamari  sweet potato truffle fries (was the BEST sweet potato fries I've ever tasted)  pasta  glazed veggies  etc. I would say that their mini burger sliders was uh-maaay-zing! It was perfectly medium rare  a little salty with melted cheese on top  and buttery buns to tie it all off. Their pasta was al-dente and rightfully sauced (I hate over-sauced pasta  but not dry either). They had flavor  not bland at all. Scalloped potatoes were a little too salty for me. I think it was the breadcrumbs  but I just brushed them aside and tasted the potatoes. I love me some potatoes. Their meat selection was all juicy  melty goodness; but I only had room for the prime rib. It was too rare for my taste  but the part that I did end up eating was delicious. \\n\\nI didn't get the chance to try their seafood  since I eat seafood almost on a daily basis so yeah... skipped those for now. I do plan on trying them on my next visit. \\n\\nDessert... there are too many good words to say about dessert. Since they have a crepe station I definitely had to try it. I got one with strawberries  REAL whipped cream  and Nutella sauce yum! I wished they'd put the toppings inside instead of on top  but that's just a personal preference. They had so much dessert selection that I was going dizzy (or maybe that was the wine?). I ended up trying their Aztec chocolate gelato  chocolate praline cake  chocolate creme brulee  and various macarons. The gelato was quite interesting. I'm not a big cinnamon fan at all but I devoured that aztec choco like it was the end of the world. It wasn't overly sweet with a hint of spicy kick. Loves it! Chocolate praline cake was so heavenly  I almost cried. If I had an extra stomach  I would definitely grab some more. Choco creme brulee was so-so. Maybe I should have tried the vanilla one instead. To me  the highlight was the french macarons. I grabbed one for each flavor. My favorite was the rose flavored one and green tea flavored macarons. \\n\\nI've never been so impressed over a buffet before. I've been to quite a number already  and honestly it all seems redundant. I'm glad that Caesar's Palace decided to open one that has more to offer than \\\"\"\"\"the usual.\\\"",

She said the price changed a few days ago. Well  they should have put up a sign or something  how was I to know that?! the 37.00 was still plastered all over the website! I figured FINE  we already waited 2 hours  we might as well.  I asked for a party of 8  and she said they couldnt do more than 4 per table!! I was in shock! I mean i knew that they were busy  but one of the tings I loved about this buffet when I was there the last time was the big huge round tables they had to accommodate large groups! Right then and there I asked to speak with a supervisor  and even she was rude.  She said  and i quote   \\\"\"\"\"Maam  you can clearly see were busy  we cant take big parties on one table.\\\"\"\"\" I told her Id be willing to wait  and she told me it was going to be \\\"\"\"\"Another 2 hours\\\"\"\"\" I was upset  so I just took it and said fine  give us 2 separate tables.\\n\\nSo we get to our table  and get this. they sit us near 4 EMPTY huge tables that seat a part of 8!!!!! I was LIVID. i went up to the front and told them about it and they said that they didnt have a server for the section  even though it was 2 feet away from us! \\n\\nOh  and it gets worse.... so we've already waited 2 hours in line right? Just the line alone to get to the food was ridiculous!!! I waited for 15 in just for crab legs..... when I went to the asian section to get the roasted duck that I wanted  it was COMPLETELY empty  and had to wait for that too.... and a lot of the stuff they used to have when I first went there was GONE.\\n\\nOverall  $44 for a buffet? Bad Service? Not enough food? Long waits? SOOOOO OVERRATED! I wont ever go back  I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long.

        "text": "\"Presidents Day weekend FAIL on the \\\"\"\"\"come for lunch  stay for dinner\\\"\"\"\" tactic. If we had gotten there 15-20 minutes earlier (1:30-2pm instead of after 2pm)  we probably would have just made it. It's just that we waited over 1.5 hours in that ridiculous line  and it seemed to get worse (but great for King Caesar!) from there on out through the rest of the afternoon and evening. It sounds like these lines (for most buffets) are only this bad during peak times and especially over holidays/holiday weekends  so plan accordingly. It's expensive (dinner is $52 and I think I heard lunch is $42 or around there). You can pay an extra $15 for the express line if you don't want to wait like the rest of the lemmings. I noticed  for a good 5-10 minutes  it seemed like the cashiers were standing around and not ringing people up (probably a \\\"\"\"\"counter-tactic\\\"\"\"\" to push it to 3pm and try to get the rest of these people in at the dinner price). Even after paying  we still had to wait 15-20 minutes to get a table. In the end  we probably waited close to 2 hours. Fortunately  we had no plans until at 7:30pm for the Beatles LOVE show...\\n\\nSo once we finally got into the buffet  I went straight to the seafood line and loaded up on king crab (they had snow crab too I think). There were oysters as well  but they kept on disappearing too fast - apparently the ratio of shuckers to consumers was severely lacking. One of the shucker guys dumped four oysters directly onto my plate after I stood there waiting for a few minutes though. The oysters were super fresh! So much so that my wife  not an oyster-eater  thoroughly enjoyed hers. The king crab legs were OK - some that we got weren't completely defrosted in some parts  so I found myself eating small bits of king crab ice at times. That said  Dungeness is still my favorite.... it's too bad they didn't have any of that cause I would have gone buck wild on it. \\n\\nMan  I felt like a kid in a candy store... now  the last time we made a quick \\\"\"\"\"pit stop\\\"\"\"\" in Vegas  we checked out Wicked Spoon. I was thoroughly impressed with that. But this is like Wicked Spoon x2  as another reviewer alluded to. It's literally almost twice as big. Amazing.\\n\\nSo I made it over to the meat station and picked up a nice chunk of brisket and a lamb chop. The lamb chop was pretty bomb. The brisket was okay. My wife got some prime rib  which looked good but by the time I stuffed myself with everything else I didn't get a good look or taste of it. She also got the spicy sausage and boy was it spicy. IMHO  the meat station at Wicked Spoon has the slight edge here. \\n\\nOther interesting stuff I picked up: \\n\\nFried chicken & sweet potato fries - I didn't enjoy this as much because I was stuffed from the plates of king crab we destroyed. It was good though  and I thought the fries were pretty awesome (I think they were drizzled or coated in honey!)\\n\\nSushi - I only had one piece but it was pretty fresh. \\n\\nShiao long bao - yes  they did have these. And surprisingly they weren't bad - soupy and flavorful as expected.\\n\\nPho and tonkatsu ramen - the broth was slightly lacking but the option to even offer these was pretty impressive.\\n\\nI was looking forward to \\\"\"\"\"chunks of honeycomb\\\"\"\"\" that someone spoke of in another review. Disappointingly  I only saw a display of it (not sure if it was a fake display or real too) behind glass. I did get some \\\"\"\"\"honeycomb honey\\\"\"\"\" which was pretty good though.\\n\\nAs far as dessert  we were pretty impressed but so stuffed full that we could hardly enjoy anything. Creme brulee  flan  mochi  gelato  chocolate covered strawberries...... EXPLODE! We seriously couldn't eat anymore... but then I just had to get a slice of pizza to cap it all off.\\n\\nIt all became somewhat overwhelming after a while  but I'd say the top things to consider: OYSTERS  crab (of course)  lamb chops  spicy sausage  sushi  fried chicken.\\n\\nOne thing I almost fainted over when I saw it was a large hot table (ala Mongolian BBQ). They were utilizing it to grill in the Mexican section  but I thought to myself \\\"\"\"\"wouldn't it be crazy if they had Mongolian BBQ?\\\"\"\"\" That would take things to another level  IMHO.\\n\\nToo much to write about... too much thinking. Still digesting. Until next time  maybe. But only on a non-holiday  off-peak hour  and for lunch going on dinner.\"",

It's the only decent buffet I haven't been to. Standing in line eagerly  even after we heard it'd be a 45 minute wait. I was excited  and hungry! Buffets are my absolute favorite  I get bored easily  so I usually opt for sushi or tapas so I can try a few things at once. \\n\\nFinally when we were seated the excitement continued  oooh Asian station  ahh seafood! Ramen and pho?? I decided to head for the Asian station first  which had some \\\"\"\"\" sushi \\\"\"\"\" and dim sum. The sushi immediately made my stomach turn and all of a sudden my hunger had vanished. The salmon was a burnt orange color.. On the verge of turning brown and the tuna just looked rotten. I was quite shocked as I saw alot of people still opting for the sushi..but I looked again and realized everyone I saw was non asian. Hmph  I decided to steer clear - I've had food poisoning once and it's definitely no fun. \\n\\nHad some dim sum which was really authentic - ( up to par with elite) The fresh shrimp was good  The king crab legs were decent  but I had a few frozen pieces which were a huge turn off. I understand that happens at Asian buffets  but c'mon! Seriously Cesar's?! \\n\\nThe prime rib line was ridiculous  stood in line for another 20 minutes. But I figured hey  this must be their best dish - but no :( my slice was far too overcooked  and I don't know who said it's better than Lawrys  but they're smoking crack. \\n\\nThe ramen and pho were surprisingly not bad. Not the best I've ever had but actually decent. Btw they don't have hoison for the pho  only sirracha.\\n\\nThe sliders looked ridiculously good oozing with cheese  but yet again overcooked. If you like your patty well done - this dish is for you. All in all my favorites were the juice section & dessert. The juice selection had fresh cucumber  tomato  grapefruit and a few others. the cucumber tasted so fresh  lovely after a night of drinking vegas. The dessert section had an amazing  lava cake. Not overly sweet  just perfect. I was quite sad they had no macarons though :( they are only made for dinner. They had a variety of gelato flavors I've never heard of  so that was cool. Try thai tea :) \\n\\nAlso - maybe this buffet was better once upon a time  because half of the dishes in the pictures were nonexsistent when I went. I probably won't be returning   for $110 after tax and tip for a party of two - the juice and dessert weren't THAT good. I'd rather go to wicked spoon or the buffet at m resort.\"",

        "text": "\"Simply put.  This is probably the most impressive buffet I have ever been to.  \\n**scroll to bottom if you would like to to see why this 5 star buffet is only 2 stars**\\n\\nI know Vegas is known for their buffets  and this is the only one I've been to there  so I'm not sure how it stacks up to the others  but all I can say is wow.\\n\\nYes  it was big.  Huge.  Over the top.  \\n\\nTo me  the best feature of this buffet is the presentation/delivery.  Most the food comes in separate dishes.  Like  for example  if you want a piece of lasagna  you don't scoop it out of a trough.... there is a little cast iron skillet with an individual serving you grab.\\n\\nWhats that  you want calamari?  There is a cute little fry basket with calamari in it  just for you.\\n\\nSure  there were some items that still were served trough style  but there were a lot of individualized portions of food that really escalated their buffet game.  It ensured you got the food the way it was intended to be served.  For example  if they were serving something with cheese on top..... if served trough style  some cheese loving behemoth could come through and steal all the cheese off the top and take little of the rest... leaving everyone else getting the entree with no cheese on top.  With these little skillets and baskets and bowls for each person  you can ensure you are getting the food it was meant to be served.\\n\\n**So why 5 stars?  Here are my reasons.**\\n--Sushi was not good.  At all.  In fact  none of the asian food I had was very good.\\n--Crab legs were served Cold on Ice... unless you request them to get heated up.  I asked the crab chef if I could have hot legs  and he said he just put some on top (of the ice) so they would be hot..... guess what  they were cold.  and the lines are so long  its not like I could just get right back in there and request hot ones again.  This pissed me off.\\n--they didn't have prime rib  or any high quality (beef) steaks for that matter.  the meat carver said they were out.. not sure if they ran out  or don't normally have it... but he said  \\\"\"\"\"were out of that tonight\\\"\"\"\"\\n--lamb was underseasoned and overcooked.  I'm talking well done.\\n--plates would pile up and nobody was clearing them.  Both the gf and I as well as another table were stacking plates on an adjacent table because there wasn't anyone clearing our table until just before we left.  We did get water refills  though  ironically.\\n--they want you to put in a tip BEFORE the meal.  What??  Maybe that's why our plates didn't get cleared.  I guess the wait staff figures their tips are already in the bag.\\n--long wait to get in... BUT for an extra $15 you can get in a VIP line.  What a crock of shit!  Want an easy way to find out whose shit doesn't stink in Vegas??  go stand outside the Bacchannal and see who is standing in the express line.  We had this group of asshats in front of use whose noses were so high in the air they were breathing a different kind of oxygen.  The whole time we were standing in line they were bitching uncontrollably about the line and how they were going to take care of it  like rotten children.  So... after literally like 15-20 minutes of listening to how much better they were than the commoners in the regular line  their dumb-asses eventually figured out how to upgrade to the express line.  Thank God.  I guess maybe it does serve a purpose after all.  My magic moment is when we waited in the regular line like everyone else  and ended up getting seated less than 5 minutes after \\\"\"\"\"team asshat\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nWith all that being said  it was still an impressive buffet to see once...  Flashy  but I wouldn't go again.  I'd rather take my $100 and put it towards a nice dinner with higher attention to quality and detail.\"",

        "text": "\"Plus: you get to people watch and see the frenzy that is Asian people collecting buffet food in extraordinarily planned fashion. (You. Crab leg line. Me. Meat line. Transfer plates. More. More.)\\nMinus: overrated.\\n\\nIt was my first time in Vegas  and I just had to try the infamous Las Vegas buffet. This is the newer one out of the bunch  and judging by photos and reviews  it looked like we were in for a luxurious feast. Not your normal buffet!\\n\\nThe line was long and sweeping  and took approximately an hour to get to the front where you pay first. Memorial Day weekend we ended up paying brunch prices  not lunch  which was approximately $50. Okay  well  I heard about the steak...and the starters..and the seafood...has to be worth it! *If you tack on $20  you can go in the express line.\\n\\nUpon entry  it looked gorgeous. The tall chairs and round tables were groups felt very cozy and intimate. Plenty of seating to go around. However  once I started lining up for the meat/other-unhealthy-yums line  I knew that my experience would begin to deteriorate. I waited 30 minutes before I even got one item on my empty plate. The buffet here operates by lines; you can't really cut in to just grab a certain dish  unless you are daring enough to brave the snarls of hungry line waiters. There were assorted Mexican rice dishes  then some salads  soups  bread rolls and cold pastas (which no one ventured into cause it curved inwards and people didn't want to lose their spot in line) before hitting the Memorial Day sliders. The sliders and small items were placed on cute colored square dishes  which take up much real estate on your plate. I saw a man plop those items on his white plate (genius!) before he got reprimanded by the chef for not taking the square plate with him. But let's be real--you have to wait so long to just get an item....people are not going to be going back in line because your plate sizes don't make sense.\\n\\nOnto the food:\\n\\nPROTEIN: Cuts of meat included rib eye (best protein here)  lamb shank (salty)  brisket (salty)  chicken (didn't try) and a fatty bacon slice. The waffle fries were in cute mini fryer baskets  but unfortunately were overly salty. \\nPASTA: baked lasagna cube. Nasty  dry  heavy....nyuck.\\nSALAD: So-so. Again with the square plates!\\nSUSHI: too much rice. If you pick off the salmon off the nigiri  you can get some good sashimi bites  though.\\nUDON/RAMEN SOUP: Actually pretty decent. The broth was yummy and not too salty! Cooked fresh per order  and the line went super fast for this.\\nDESSERT: crepes were one of the highlights of Bachannal desserts. It's DIY except for the fresh crepe. The lava cake was good  but overly heavy and dense. fresh  no yucky icicle ridden gelato here. They only give you 1 mini scoop which again  takes up valuable plate real estate if you get more than 1 flavor.\\nSEAFOOD: Shrimp was wonderful. crab legs were good  but mine were cold. You'll have to wait for the fresh steamed one and work at it. No oysters until dinner service...sad.\\nSIDES: only liked the fresh vegetables  which was probably cooked in butter. The mac and cheese was dense. Salty fries. \\nDRINKS: peach green tea for the win.\\n\\nService was good--the people clearing plates were very  very fast and efficient. However  drinks were very slow. It's too overpriced and too limited in good items that you can get at subpar restaurants. You might as well take the $50 and go to a nice steakhouse. \\\"\"\"\"Las Vegas buffets\\\"\"\"\"--nothing to see here at Bachannal  folks. Move on.\"",

I went for a weekday lunch and the price was $33  ouch!!  This is compared to $25 at the Wynn.  I really like the Wynn a lot  so I was expecting a lot more at this place.  Unfortunately  nothing excited me at this buffet.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them  but pretty much everything was underwhelming that day.  A lot of the food did not get refilled in a timely manner and a lot of the signs were not in front of the food  so you did not know what some things were.\\n\\nIn terms of the food  I guess I got used to the Wynn  Wicked Spoon and the Bellagio.  Most of the food here was cheapie food  not that there is anything wrong with that  as I love cheapie food.  Its just when I go to one of these buffets  I expect to try high end dishes I do not usually eat on a regular basis.  They had street tacos  bbq meats  chinese food and noodles like pho  udon and ramen.  I would much rather get these types of foods in hole in the wall restaurants and they are much better at those places.  The food overall was ok  but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buffet on the strip  I think the food should be much better than just ok.",

        "text": "First of all  I'm nothing if not cheap  so I sympathize with those reviewers who balk at spending $50+ to go to a freakin' buffet\\n\\n. After all  this is Las Vegas  birthplace of the incredibly cheap chow line  subsidized by gaming revenues and scoffing at the prospect of making money from the lowly food and beverage department. I get it. So  I highly recommend the practice of not eating during the day (easy if you sleep late)  and arriving in line ON A WEEKDAY just before 3 p.m. That way  your wait in line will be practically non-existent  you will pay the lunch price (closer to $30)  and they start trotting out the higher-end dinner items (I'm talking heated crab legs and lollipop rib eyes) almost immediately.\\n\\n  Now  imagine that you and a companion went for dinner in a regular restaurant  were served a basket of artisan breads with an assortment of cheeses and homemade jams  then you had a fried calamari appetizer  lobster corn chowder  Caesar salad  prime rib and crab leg combo  with broccoli au gratin and whipped potatoes  and creme' caramel for dessert. \\n\\nYour date had the oyster shooter  cream of mushroom soup  heirloom tomato caprese salad  saut\\u00e9ed halibut with haricots vert and scalloped truffled potatoes  and a nutella crepe with bananas and whipped cream. Assuming you didn't have to be wheeled out  would you squawk if you were presented a bill for a little over $60? I think not. Of course  you have to factor in the major inconvenience of walking 10 feet to get it yourself  but that horrific downside is somewhat modified by the fact that while you're up there anyway  you can help yourself to more Asian  Italian  Mexican  seafood  dessert  etc.  options than even the fattest of fatties could ever hope to sample in a week  let alone a couple of hours (in other words  until you're full to the point of physical distress).\\n\\n And here's the thing: you may not like every single thing you choose  some things may not be prepared exactly to your liking. Don't eat it!!! It's a buffet! Trot yourself up and pick out 15 more things until you stumble across stuff that meets your standards. Make yourself happy! This place is great and deserves 5 stars just for the fact that they have some poor OCD guy back in the kitchen cutting up watermelon and feta cheese and assembling them into those little checkerboard squares.\\n\\n.And we have had nothing but good experiences with the servers  especially the meat cutter   who act like they're actually glad you're there. I hate to say it  but it's possible that if you don't like this place  maybe you don't really like food?",

They have different types of crab  asian and small snow crab legs which are cold unless you ask the staff behind the counter to dip your legs in hot water.  They are very small but good.  The shrimp were very good and very large.  It is a lovely place and staff was great.  Went for Sunday brunch and you get  mimosas with the meal which were very good.  I will return again even though it's pretty expensive.  Loved it!",

They have brisket  prime rib  sushi  fried rice  crab legs  shrimp  baked potatoes  lots of bread  deli meats and cheeses  made to order tacos  Mexican rice  salad bar  grilled veggies  and SO MUCH MORE! The dessert selection is just beyond amazing. I've never seen so much dessert in my life. I wish I could've tried it all.

We sat down at a half booth half table in the bar next to a large party and were greeted by a young man named Aaron.  He immediately told us the table was reserved as the party next to us had more people coming...thats funny I didn't know you could reserve tables in a bar during HH.  So here I am 9 months pregnant told to get up and move to an uncomfortable high top.  My husband mentions that if a table is reserved it should have signs on it so people don't sit down and have to move.  Instead of saying Im sorry or I'll let a manager know Aaron decides to get snappy and tell us we should just get there earlier next time. Thanks Aaron  we'll keep that in mind when we go anywhere but this Buffalo Wild Wings location.  As we got up to leave he sarcastically said goodbye and proceeded to be argumentative with my husband when he told him that his customer service skills were seriously lacking. Its a shame because we live right down the street and used to come here 2-3 times a month.",

Great guacamole with just the right amount of spice and chunkiness without being overly done. I sort of judge a Mexican spot by its chips  salsa and margaritas.  Milagro scored pretty high on all 3 counts.  Dang  now I want a margarita...  I digress.\\nI recently went here for dinner and had tacos (they let you mix n match!)  The Al Pastor and Mahi were very good  but I think the green chile pork was my favorite taco.  That could change in the future  but right now I'm having a moment with green chile.  Couple of the guys at the table got the Filet & crab and devoured it.  The non-spicy mac n cheese got good reviews from others with our party as well.  \\nI think Milagro is a solid spot.  They aren't usually very busy. Both times I've visited were with big groups (10-12) and we were seated promptly.  Service was good on both visits and the prices are fair.

He is so nice and very knowledgeable- just what you want in a dermatologist!  Also  when I asked about Botox he didn't try to pressure me to get more than was necessary or push it on me right then and there. He just clearly gave me the facts and a quote  which I really appreciated.  No pushy sales approach  just helpful info.  Also  he told me that he does the injections himself- unlike a lot of places that have nurses or PAs do them instead of the doctor. Bonus!  The office was beautiful and clean  and the staff was super nice.  You can tell he's from KY - he's got those good Southern manners.  Also  he's very affordable for how experienced he is and how gorgeous the office is!

The chicken is all white meat chicken breast and the steak is very  very high quality beef. The seasonings are just right -- not too spicy for a normal palate yet packed with flavor. Make sure you get a side of their homemade green sauce  it is killer good. \\n\\nThe freshly baked naan-style bread is amazing. I could gobble it up plain but I like to stack my meat on top so it soaks up the juices. Since I am a low carb eater  I didn't try the rice but instead got a side salad. It  too  consisted of simple yet high quality ingredients. They only have one housemade salad dressing that's exotic and very fresh tasting. This isn't a place to go if you are in a rush  they really do cook everything to order so it can take about 15 minutes to get your dinner.\\n\\nThe main dining room is nothing special but is decorated with pretty granite tables and there's even a nice couch seating area. There are a few tables outside on a small patio that afford gorgeous views of McCarran's runway so you can watch planes take off and land while you eat. The restaurant is located in a nondescript shopping strip center amongst office buildings and gets super popular during the workday; go in the evening or on the weekend for less crowds. \\n\\nThere are three main problems I have with this place. One  the prices are just too high. I know fresh  made-to-order food costs money  but when I have to shell out nearly $40 for two of us to eat a light dinner at a quick service restaurant  that's really hitting me in my pocketbook! The portion sizes are out of whack with the prices; the portions are pretty small yet still expensive. I had to order TWO kabobs to fill me up.\\n\\nTwo  the overuse of styrofoam sends a bad message. Why trash our environment more by using ALL styrofoam? Surely there's a more eco-friendly way to plate your food! Styrofoam containers are so 1980  get with the modern times. People do care about our environment and responsible business owners should too. \\n\\nThird  the employees can be a little off-putting. It was my first time in and the guy taking my order seemed less than thrilled to have me as a guest. As I sat waiting for my food  several other patrons came in and told the guy behind the counter that it was their first time and even asked for recommendations. The employee said  very bruquesly  that he didn't know what they would like and offered ZERO help to these poor people. That's a sure way to make sure people NEVER set foot in your restaurant again.\\n\\nI absolutely love the food here and the quality and taste of my meal outweighed all of the negatives  thus resulting in my 4 star review.",

The falafel wrap had 2 small falafel with some plain chopped lettuce tucked into a pita bread. There was a little bit of a greenish sauce but it was tasteless. My wrap was accompanied by some chopped and seasoned onions as well as a small bit of lettuce greens and a large lemon wedge. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE LEMON WEDGE! I ended up covering my meal in the lemon juice to give it some flavor.

Now the characters just stand on stage and sing to the audience but the audience has no idea what they're saying. (Two of the people I went with thought the words were in French and they just didn't understand because they didn't speak it.) It's like they didn't bother to change the staging when they got rid of the story  and the end result is awful. Plus the female screeching has got to go. Bring earplugs.\\n\\nThe second half of the show features some really good acrobatic acts. The trapeze is one of the best out there  though Myst\\u00e8re's new trapeze act certainly rivals it and makes Zarkana feel redundant. We've also seen the Wheel of Death before in K\\u00c0.

It wasn't the talent level of the singers  which was very high  but rather the songs themselves were just awful.  There was lots of screeching and talking and singing in a made up language.  The transitions between the scenes were disjointed and while the sets were very lavish  it seemed like Cirque ripped off sets from past shows and borrowed ideas from The Fifth Element.  There was no big moment at the beginning or end of the show  which I have come to expect from Cirque performances.  I kept waiting for it to get better  but it never did.  Please  Aria  give us Les Miserables  Book of Mormon  or another Broadway quality production instead of another Cirque show that just can't compete with ANY of the other Cirque shows that already are playing in Vegas.  Aria is such an amazing hotel and this production just doesn't rise to the same level of quality as the rest of the attractions located at this property.",

I guess they're really desperate to steal business from the ringling brothers. \\n\\nTwo reasons why it's getting a 2. One I cant rate it at a 1.5.

I've seen many of the cirque shows here in Vegas over the years (e.g.  Ka  Mystere  O  etc.) and I'm not sure why this show has bad reviews. Right from the beginning this experience was great. We were fortunate to get tickets closer to the front and I have got to say that these were the most comfortable seats.. they were wider and just plain pleasant to sit in. Right before the show started  like most cirque shows  they had the actors come out to entertain the crowd which was really fun. One of the actors who was carrying a spell book of some sort was given some popcorn by an audience member. He put a kernel on a guys head and wouldn't let him take it off even while he was walking away. It was really funny and a 'you had to have been there' type of thing. There were other funny things going on around the theater too. \\n\\nThe show had some really good acts. I especially enjoyed the juggler  she was also kind of feisty and worked the crowd well with a few eyebrow flicks and a smile. The sand artist was excellent as well  she was so quick and the pictures she created were beautiful. Like a typical cirque show it had a lot of acrobats and high flying acts and of course they were extremely talented and fun to watch. Sure the show is light on story but the acts are all top notch. \\n\\nTo sum up  if you want to watch a good cirque show in Vegas with great acrobatics and artistry and don't mind little story this would be a fun one to go and see. It's a very nice break from losing money gambling. :)",

Unfortunately  she was sick and had to cancel  but we stayed the course and went there as planned.\\n\\nWhen we arrived  the hostess said she had a half booth/half table available for us  despite the fact that there were about 4-5 open booths in sight. I mentioned this  and she said that the server in that section was overwhelmed  and that she didn't want us to have a poor experience. Okay  so kudos to her for being honest; shame on management for being so poorly staffed on a Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas. Reluctantly we did the half table.\\n\\nWe sat there for literally 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. Finally  it was the same hostess that came and poured some water for us  saying someone would be right out.\\n\\nThat should have been our exit right then and there. But  we stayed.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice  but she called me \\\"\"\"\"sweetheart\\\"\"\"\" as soon as she came to the table. Now  I wouldn't take notice usually IF the waitress were older than me  or I was in the South. However  she was young  and Vegas is definitely not the South; it really rubbed me weird. Other than that  she was friendly and took our orders: Steak & Eggs special  for $15 each.\\n\\nAfter ordering  we waited. And waited. And waited. The food took forever to come out  with the waitress showing up only once to say that the orders were almost ready. No \\\"\"\"\"Can I get you anything while you wait?\\\"\"\"\" or anything. Meh.\\n\\nWe ordered our steaks medium rare. When the plates came  mine was brown all the way through and my girlfriend's was barely pink. We opted just to eat and get the hell out  because the meal was going to be comped off of our account anyway by the M Life folks. However  the food was SO bland and tasteless  we were really put off.\\n\\nMy girlfriend ate maybe 1/3 of her food and I about 2/3 (the hash browns and scrambled eggs were okay). At that point  we were done. Our waitress never came over to ask how everything was once. Finally  she came and without asking  simply picked up our plates.\\n\\nHere's the thing - if you were a server in a restaurant and one of your guests barely ate anything on her plate  wouldn't you be trained or even INCLINED to ask if there was a problem with the food? Not even a little bit? Nope; nada. She just picked up the plates and left.\\n\\nIn the end  I asked to speak to the manager. It was a young guy  and when he asked what was wrong  I wasn't an ass about it  but I told him I couldn't remember a worse meal in recent memory in Las Vegas. He asked what specifically was wrong  and I told him whoever was in the kitchen didn't deserve to be working there - that we could have gone to McDonald's in the food court and had tastier food. I then explained that I'd ordered my steak medium rare and it was as pink as the sole on my Doc Martin. He said he wished we'd told him sooner  and then I mentioned that would be impossible since we hadn't seen our waitress the entire time we had our food except for when she came to collect the plates. I told him his staff was not good  nor were they intuitive to guests' needs at all - or they simply are use to this and don't care anymore.\\n\\nThe manager was apologietic and asked us to give them another chance during our weekend  and I explained that honestly  in Vegas  where there are SO many GOOD choices of exciting restaurants that there was virtually no margin for this type of horrible service. I was frank  and told him we wouldn't be coming back. At that point  he took the check  said he'd take care of it and walked away; it was obvious that he'd dismissed us and that it was over.\\n\\nRegardless of whether a meal is going to be comped or not - and there is no way for a kitchen staff to know anyway - NO restaurant in Vegas should be content with this  and no management team should be okay with it. Shame on Luxor too  for not being aware that this is happening in one of their prime food locations.\\n\\nI'd avoid Public House at Luxor completely; you can do much  much better than to waste a Vegas meal opportunity here.\"",

I was sorely disappointed. First  during Yelp's Brunchy Munchy  I thought my pancakes with bacon tasted ok but were quite overpriced for two itsy bitsy pancakes and a lack of friendliness on the part of the staff. The restaurant was attractively decorated and they did accommodate our large group  but without much grace as many others really didn't like what they were served.\\n\\nAlthough I really wanted to like the Edinburgh Larder Bistro because of their mission to serve good quality food made from locally-sourced ingredients  I was on the fence after the brunch about whether I liked this place. I wanted to give it a second try  so my boyfriend and I purchased a groupon for a two-course lunch here. Since I work from home and his work is also flexible  we had brought our backpacks with our computers with us so we could work from New Town in the afernoon. When we showed up at our appointed time for our reservation  the staff looked us up and down and led us to the back room (they obviously wanted to hide us in the back!). At our table  the woman looked us up and down again and  after a long pause and looking disdainingly at our bags  said that other customers would be coming in and sitting next to us so could she take our bags to the other room since they would need the space? She could have framed this much more tactfully and asked if she could help us by relieving us of our bags by taking them out of our way!\\n\\nAlthough things had a rocky start  I liked the simple menu of just a few items that were the fresh specialties of the day made from in-season  local ingredients. We both had the mushroom soup to start. The soup was good and better than a run-of-the-mill cream of mushroom soup but it wasn't too special or memorable. Since we had heard about the Larder Bistro's great bread and thought that bread would be the perfect addition to our starter  we were a bit sad that we weren't served any. Later  during our main course  we were frustrated to see other customers were served bread with their soup while we had not been!\\n\\nFor my main  I had the fish. While I was expecting a flavourful  locally-caught fish  I was underwhelmed by the dish. Although it scored high on presentation and looked quite pretty  it's taste wasn't on the same calibre. To make things worse  when I was over half-way through my meal I found a hair in my dish. I didn't think it was mine but then again I wasn't quite sure. I ate a bit more from other parts of my plate but that was the not-so-perfect end to our lunch.\\n\\nEven though the Larder Bistro might had wanted more posh customers and we didn't seem to meet their expectations  they should have treated us just as well as the other customers (the two older ladies sitting a few tables away  or the couple sitting behind us -- and  no  there was still no one actually sitting at either of the tables next to us!). The other customers were welcomed warmly  had their coats kindly taken out of their way and received bread with their soup. We aren't slobs and we were a bit taken aback by the poor service and underwhelming lunch after hearing such lovely reviews prior to our visits here. In the future  I hope that the staff become more friendly and caring and that the quality of the food matches the prices they are charging for it.",

After some questioning  she allegedly crossed out their names too.  Umm  really???  The girl had no clue.\\n\\nFinally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient.  OK  we are patient.  We order our food  a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich.  As we are waiting  and waiting  and waiting  we hear the waitress scolding customers.....\\\"\"\"\"I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer  you chose to wait.  Really????   At another table she says the same thing.  The table next to us  once they get their food  complain and leave without even touching it.  Oh my!!!!\\n\\nApparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd.  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above  took 70 minutes to get to us.....YES! 70 MINUTES!!!!!!!!  I can't believe we waited that long.  We were so mad  but at some point we were too invested.\\n\\nOnce the food comes.....no chips.  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet.  Really!!!!?????\\n\\nThe food was decent  no complaints there.  Every single table  though  was mad and upset about the wait.  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant  and I eat out A LOT!\\n\\nAnyway  stay away from this place.  They don't deserve your business.  This  by the way  is also the first \\\"\"\"\"bad\\\"\"\"\" review I have ever written.. They should be ashamed!\"",

Every time I have been in this establishment (approximately 3 times  I have a friend who swears by the place)  there are way more employees than customers.  They clean non-stop  which isn't a bad thing in terms of it being a very clean place.  However  they are always noisily pulling out tables and chairs  standing on chairs cleaning lamps  and other incredibly distracting things.  If I am trying to talk to someone and eat  it is hard to do when all I hear are the 15 employees talking and tables scraping across the floor.  Also  most of the employees that work the registers are not very genuinely friendly.  It seems like a forced effort  as though talking to you is the last thing they want to be doing.

I am gluten free and was very impressed with their gluten free menu...it's pretty extensive! And they offer gluten free buns which is great and definitely not something you get everywhere.

Coming here on a Saturday morning  I expected the atmosphere to be calm and relaxing. It felt like a club  with the latest pop/electronic hits playing in the background. Also  someone had recommended the parmesan cream truffle fries  but they did not live up to my expectations. Over a span of 15-20 minutes  the cream sauce on the fries congealed in a non-appetizing fashion. \\n\\nOther than those two things though  I enjoyed Dlux. The donut balls are great. The strawberry cream sauce that accompanied them was super tasty and complemented the indulgent fried dough balls. I got the spicy sausage breakfast sandwich  and the sriracha mayo sauce made the sandwich incredible. I would also recommend getting the sweet potato fries with the aforementioned sriracha mayo dip. I'm a little biased because I love sweet potato fries  but they're worth it.\\n\\nThe espresso milkshake was also great. Espresso grinds mixed in with ice cream. Simple and delicious.

A few tips before you go:\\n-Everyone wears socks with treads on the bottom.  They sell them at the studio  but you can pick up a similar yoga pair somewhere else.\\n-When you go for the first time  the instructor will tell you what equipment you need (weights  a ball  and a band)  so that's helpful.\\n-Everyone there looks like they stepped out of the Lululemon catalog.  Don't be intimidated; you can do this workout too!\\n\\nThe class starts off fast and doesn't stop.  If you think you're getting a break to stretch  you're not.  The instructor does give you some adjustments  but a lot of the movements are so small that it's tough to know what's right.  My method is to just go by feel; if it's tough  it's probably working.

They have changed the name to Spice Asian Bistro as well. Shame the old owners had happy loyal customers and now the new ones are going to run a once amazing place out of business.\"",

Couldn't complain about the drink prices. The manager was pretty helpful  and gave me an industry discount (I'm a bartender) when he brought the check.\\n\\nCons: Absolutely the worst service I've had in years  by far! We sat down on the patio  where most of the other guests were  for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped. He got us some water and sent the server over. He took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks. We didn't see him again for quite a long time. I was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one. Every time the waiter was at our table  it was because the manager had told him to go there. \\n I had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and I no longer had any interest in staying. Once again  the manager handled the situation very well (sending the waiter over and discounting the bill). After we had the bill  the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed. He was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book. It was really uncomfortable.  The moment the book closed  the waiter had it in his hands. He ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip. (as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15% even for crappy service. this service warranted $1 however.) \\n Nobody expects incredible service in a bar. It's a real laid-back place. I do expect some service though. It is  after all  why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar  but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad  he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot  but I will be sitting at the bar if i do.

I didn't feel treated with respect by her and at 33 weeks have switched providers. (After doing this I've heard at least one other story of this particular doctor being a challenge).

Sadly it's located in Verdun and only a special occasion would bring me to this part of town... as luck would have it a small community Yelp event brought close to a dozen Yelpers to this place during happy hour. I just couldn't say no to this.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed is that it's pretty much a hole in a wall  you can easily walk RIGHT by without even noticing it. Parking in this area is also ridiculously difficult as the area houses countless duplexes that has locals taking up all the parking spots leaving you to take the paid parking spots... which haven't been modernized in any shape or form. It's 2014 folks  I've been paying my parking spots all over Montreal for the last decade from an mobile app or parking machine that accepts credit cards... why is this place still accepting coins? Ridiculous!\\n\\nI ordered their reputed burnt ends poutine and some root beer. The service was about an average wait but they were kind enough to bring me my food while I was sitting outside on their terrace with fellow Yelpers while I nursed my root beer. :)\\n\\nSadly  I wasn't a fan of their poutine. While the metal encased portion was generous and it was definitely heavy... I couldn't finish it for multiple reasons. \\n\\nKindly note  that I feel I might be the oddball here but I felt the fries weren't up to par to what I've had for places hyped such as this place. The cheese was somewhat skimped on and the gravy sauce... which should hold everything together... was weak. The brisket meat was good though. They do offer you some BBQ sauce bottles to spice up their poutine such as a sweet or spicy sauce container but I honestly feel if you NEED to do this  your poutine isn't really what it should be. Fries  cheese curds  gravy. Maybe some extra condiments to your liking... that's what it should be. Sweet or spicy sauce shouldn't be added. But that's just me. However  the sweet sauce made the mediocre poutine actually more edible. So Hooray?\\n\\nThe price tag is somewhat expensive for poutine. I know there's a sort of gastronomic feeling to have that meat in your poutine  I still felt this poutine was far more expensive than it should be. \\n\\nI'm sure from other reviews they have other quality things one can order but I haven't had the chance and thus my reviews is solely for the poutine and thus  it's pretty forgettable amongst stiff competition in Montreal and while other Yelpers beside me were dealing with hairs found in their portion of poutine or the extremely fatty cuts of brisket  I guess this place simply isn't for me.",

Truly the most disappointing experiences I've had with a health provider. They're so-called communication would be laughable if not for making my life so God damned difficult! Whenever they make mistakes  and in my case  they make a lot  they blame it on Goodman & Partridge being in a different building and so they get lots of things wrong because they can't effectively communicate. I'm so tired of that excuse because it has become clear that they have no intentions of making that system any better and therefore reducing confusion and their mistakes. They appear to like blaming all and everything on what I believe is try a benign inconvenience and one they really could fix and improve on  if they wanted to  but they obviously don't.\\n\\nAfter speaking to their triage nurse on Saturday  related to increasing pain due to my need for surgery on Tuesday...\\n\\nOh. Wait. I have to get this out there too. I'm told by Dr. Grier this past Wednesday that I need surgery. I ask when. She says they'll call next week. I return a call from their scheduler Thursday. No one calls me back. I call again Friday. She asks if I ate anything or took my medicine? Yes I have  why? Oh darn  she wanted me to come in for the surgery? WHAT? I don't have anyone to come with me as this is no notice at all. She says  but your in pain. I say  no kidding  still  I have nothing prepared. I was told next week. She says to go in on Saturday. Fine. I call my fianc\\u00e9 and he gets the day off. She calls me back hours later explaining that while she was waiting on some other doctor to agree to my surgery  as it would not be dr. Grier  she lost my Saturday slot and now I'm to come in on Tuesday. I really wish she had her act together before putting me through all this bs but fine. Tuesday. Fine.\\n\\nSo the triage nurse gave me instructions related to pain medicine and assured me that she would note my record so on Monday Dr. Grier would see her notes and make the appropriate adjustments for me.\\n\\nI came in for my appt. At 11:10 for the sole purpose of taking care of my medicines before surgery tomorrow. My pain doctor already knew dr. Grier and had already okayed her writing me certain scripts as she had already done so only two weeks ago without a problem and before I had told my pain specialist about her. NOW  I had not only spoken to my pain specialist  I got the exact numbers of medicine that they were comfortable with her writing for.\\n\\nSo. Everything was in order. I was there for my appt and better prepared even than last time. So easy peasy  right? WRONG!! After nearly 45 minutes of waiting and watching patients who came in after me go in and then come out again  I asked about my appt. I was told that she was backed up  that there was no notes from the triage nurse from the weekend (but that was normal. Did I know this happens all the time because the triage and appointment people are at different locations? UGH!) and they didn't even know why I was there to begin with  although I had an appt at 11:10.\\nI calmly explained (for the 4th time to these frigin people) that I was there to pick up my pain medicine as I was going to be a drooling fool tomorrow and I wanted to be certain that everything was arranged as my particular situation may make another doctor  as the surgeon who will care for me tomorrow might and who doesn't know me as Grier does  confused. I even tell her the okayed doses and amounts from my pain doctor are. I even offer that she can skip my time if she could just kindly write out the script  like she did two weeks ago  and I would happily return to my bed and heating pad.\\nShe disappears for 20 minutes. Upon her return  I am informed that she won't and she said there was no explanation. Of course there wasn't  there was no reason to say no if she understood the entire matter. Which she didn't. Without being in the room I already know what quite likey happened. She mish mashed my entire message and as apparently the triage notes were gone she had no idea of the entire scenario. Plus  it was almost lunch time. I decided to stay and explain myself to her face to face. I was assured that my place in line was as it was before  she would see me next for sure. Appointment arrival 11:05 - Appointment time 11:10 - Told I was next 11:55 - brought into room 11:59 - Sat in agonizing pain until 12:50ish - Stormed out a minute later. Staff are shocked that I was not seen yet but helpless to do anything as the \\\"\"\"\"doctors do their own thing.\\\"\"\"\"\\nI really don't know what the hell that means. You mean to tell me that no one could run back to the lunchroom and kindly remind her that her patient had waited two hours for her and was in too much pain to wait any longer? Apparently they couldn't  as they didn't even apologize as I exited the office. Truly horrible! If I didn't need this surgery 2 weeks ago I would completely wash my hands of this place!!\"",

It is a complete let down  as are most haunted attractions in the past few years. \\nThe outside is more fun than the inside. They tell you it is 20 min to go through... YEAH RIGHT!!!!  maybe including the  long video they show you 100 times while you are waiting. It was maybe 10 min and I am being VERY generous with that. The themes could be good but i don't know they just fall short. I expected more from a serious horror film maker. The gore doesn't even really look good.  There were a couple of cool scenes but most were just cheesy. I don't recommend this to anyone. We got our tickets for $21 each but they charge $30 at the door. This is maybe worth $5 to $10 at best. Everyone talks about the great view at the end but it really was just average as well. Save your cash.  Check out my many many other Haunted attraction reviews.",

I also ordered a flourless chocolate cake for dessert  and would highly recommend it! It melted in my mouth. Overall  I didn't find any negatives about the experience and would go again!",

Apparently this bar/restaurant/gastropub has been in the works for years now and renovation and expansion of the old ecclesiastical building feels like it has been going on for a long time  and undeniably it has.  \\n\\nIn the 2000s  this used to be the location of the old Steeple Lounge  it may not be immediately apparent to those not from the neighborhood  but this building is not entirely new but rather it is an expansion on an existing building.  Indeed it is unrecognizable. \\n\\nAmbiance:\\nStrangely  the exterior is similar to the new Cook-Out restaurants that clashes with the contemporary \\\"\"\"\"Arts & Crafts\\\"\"\"\" interior.  Despite the clashing aesthetics  the rich woods and dark colors complement one another very well.  This restaurant/bar is three-story's tall with each floor having its own bar.  The main bar is on the first floor and throughout the whole place you can find seating area for eating.  The terrace with spectacular views of downtown Charlotte on the third floor is already very popular and reservations are highly encouraged in order to eat al fresco.\\n\\nFood & Drink:\\nThey have over twenty craft beers (including local) and an array of wines by the glass and bottle. For those who prefer non-alcoholic drinks there are non-alcoholic beers  root beers  sweet teas  juices  and soft drinks.\\n\\nFrom experience  one would expect this to be solely a burger place.  Since they just opened  they are offering a limited version of their full menu.  However  they offer more than just the typical \\\"\"\"\"bar food.\\\"\"\"\"  \\n\\nThe types of dishes you can find are: \\n\\n*Asian Fusion - such as Bahn Mi  Vietnamese Hoagie\\n*British - such as Fish & Chips & Sheppard's Pie\\n*New American - Burgers galore including vegetarian variations.\\n*Poutine - French-Canadians rejoice  but their version comes with oxtails.\\n\\n~Prices in the menu range from $10-$30.  Reasonable  and runs the gamut for different budgets.\\n\\nIf you want to eat a full meal here  you must order before 10:00pm  because after that the Peculiar Rabbit only offers drinks and \\\"\"\"\"BarBites\\\"\"\"\" (appetizers) till closing time.\\n\\nI had the veggie burger and it was very tasty  it was tofu based  with shitake mushrooms  brown rice  rolled oats  and other delectable ingredients.\\n\\nMy experience here was nice and from looking at the enthusiastic crowd tonight  one can deduct this establishment will become a very popular locale in the near future.\"",

No mention was made that it was a soft opening with limited menu  but that was indeed the case.\\n\\nWe walked in to see some friendly smiles awaiting us at the hostess stand which is front and center . The bottom floor was suppose to be \\\"\"\"\"fine dining\\\"\"\"\" the middle more casual  and the top the rooftop bar. I noticed a smell of cigarette smoke as I walked to the second floor and was told that smoking is permitted on the rooftop patio. In my opinion there is nothing like cig smoke to ruin a meal  and felt that smoking should be limited till after dining hours. \\n\\nThe patio itself was VERY dark (see photo- and that's before sundown). That being said it's a great view of the sky line. Our server did not light the small candles at our table and we went to our neighbors to borrow a lighter. The dim light was not nearly bright enough to see and our table resorted to using their cell phone lights to eat by. My meal had very small bones in it too so I had to be extra careful. If you're drinking at this establishment watch your drink  the dim lights unfortunately leave you susceptible to all kinds of things. Another issue was the chairs were much higher than the table and my 5'7 frame had my legs brushing the table- many of the men in our group couldn't fit their legs underneath.\\n\\nOur server was a newbie. The dinner service took quite a long time  it was about an hour before we were even able to get our order in (and had to request to do so). She opened a bottle of champagne and was about to literally tilt and pop it until I suggested she use her apron and slowly open it like a soda bottle. She explained she never opened a bottle before. I found that odd for a place that is attempting to be a fine-dining establishment . I asked for some orange juice because I didn't care for the champagne I ordered and she just brought the juice and didn't consider I might have preferred something else. She also walked away from the table mid-sentence while taking our order to  pour drinks at the table next to us. Any issue we had was met with the same excuse \\\"\"\"\"it's our soft opening.\\\"\"\"\" We were still paying full price so we expected our meals and service to at least be decent.\\n\\nBread was served quite late  and we were definitely hungry two hours into the meal when our food came out.  The taste was  good but the portions were extremely small  temperatures were off (soup was cool)   and it was overpriced. My friend ordered a $15 sandwich ( about the size of an egg Mcmuffin) and asked if it came with a side. Our server said she didn't know and to order it anyway. When she brought it out she explained it wasn't included. Throughout our meal we literally ate with our cell phone lights and the experience was laughable.  We actually had people in our group order additional food at the next place we stopped because they were still very hungry. \\n\\nI apologize for the long-winded review  but honestly the part which burned me the most was when we explained that it was our friends bday she actually told the birthday girl they didn't do birthdays - the birthday girl! I spoke with management who brought out two desserts after I explained the situation. She was nice and definitely listened to my problems but two small desserts for 8 people was a bit insufficient considering the number of problems we had. \\n\\nI will give it another shot because it is in the neighborhood  but I'm not sure I'd go as far to order food again there. I hope this place can do better ....\"",

When the sandwich came  my sister who was also with me said the following: \\\"\"\"\"Your sandwich looks like something they would sell at a gas station in South Carolina\\\"\"\"\".  I think that was a completely fair assessment.  For a $11 club sandwich and 45 min wait  I had pictured a sandwich carefully crafted with shaved ham and turkey (as advertised on the menu).

The cars included a 1923 Ford coexisting with a Chevy El Camino  a Plymouth Road Runner  1978 Trans Am  and every classic car imaginable. Just like a good museum  the cars included information about their year and make. A good number of the cars had the hoods popped open to display the engines. The vehicle owners were there to share information. There was even a stand displaying hundreds of Match Box and Hot Wheels cars for sale.\\n\\n  The Super Run Classic Car Show featured a few food concessions plus a beer garden. They sold corn dogs  smoothies  hot dogs  burgers  sausages  and fries. Personally I have mixed feelings about the food concessions in downtown events. My understanding is that the events are entertainment that helps stimulate the downtown economy. On Water Street so much of the downtown economy is restaurants and bars.  I'd do my part by supporting the Cafe in the El Dorado  the Coffee House  and the Gold Mine Tavern because they plan to be in the community for the long run. Besides  lately I'm not too crazy over the taste of carnival food.\\n\\n  In my reporting of the Super Clasic Car Show  what made Super Run Classic Car Show shine was that it made Water Street shine. I never saw Water Street so happening on a weekend afternoon. For a day Water Street looked like US 66 when GTOs ruled the road. A Water Street that is usually empty on a Sunday morning was\\u00a0animated\\u00a0with people. These people were supporting local businesses. From my observation  business was up on Water Street. There was even a 15 minute wait to eat in the Cafe. It also seemed that the casinos and bars were busier.\\n\\n    When I look back on the Super Run Car Show  I think of how it made Water Street shine on a weekend afternoon  When I look back on this event  I look forward to more local events.",

They made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand. Oh and! we also had security at our table so randoms couldn't linger up in there. \\n\\nNeedless to say the night was awesome! I felt really well treated  the music was bumpin and my boyfriend had a GREAT time....success. I don't know why I don't do this every weekend?? It made me want to get a table every time I go there. \\n\\nThanks Firehouse!",

If you're a Vegas local living in the Green Valley area you're probably excited a place comparable to Insert Coins has opened up on your side of town. This could not be further from the truth. If you're coming here for the arcade games be prepared to be disappointed. This is NOT Insert Coins. Not even close.\\n\\nMy experience was also highlighted by a security guard interrupting the conversation I was having to tell me to make sure the sandals I was wearing were all the way on my feet! I was sitting on a stool and one of my sandals (apparently?) was not on my foot all the way. Now  I'm all about hygiene  cleanliness  and for following the rules  but this guy was extremely rude. How about tending to the line out the door  or the drunk guy at the bar  instead of worrying about my sandal. \\n\\nTo top it off  the arcade area isn't even 21 and over.

Having said that  after seeing them for various reasons over the last year and a half  I have determined that they simply do not care.  \\n\\nTo be more specific  both my wife and I can sense that we are no more than just a number.  After a bad experience where I was told to wait for over 45 minutes when I was early for my appt. (as requested) they made me sit in their lobby for 30 minutes past my appt. time.  I emailed a letter expressing my displeasure w/ this on their website.  I received an email from what I believe was the Manager of the location.  I was asked to call her.  I did that and left a voicemail.  That call was never returned.  I simply asked for a call back.  \\n\\nThe latest two incidents helped to make our final decision.  I had an episode at home where I had chest pain and turned pale  then a few minutes later got physically ill and almost passed out.  I called to set up an appt. for a check up and to see if maybe I had had a heart issue and was told that the earliest they could see me was 22 days away.  I told my friend about this and he said  what I had thought the entire time.  That is  if something like that had happened to him and he told his physician  they would want to see him ASAP\\n.  \\nThe second issue I have is that my wife has endometriosis and had surgery earlier this year through Banner to remove cysts.  Not only did the surgeon not remove all the cysts  but my wife is now continuing to feel pain.  When she went back to her OBGYN at Banner  she was told that a certain drug might help.  My wife was then told that they would have to have insurance approval for this treatment.  We have a PPO plan.  My issue  is that even if our plan doesn't cover the expense  we will pay it to ease her pain.  Why should insurance be the determining factor?  Heck  we'll even prepay in 100 dollar bills if that's what it takes.  When my wife decided to seek a second opinion and needed to go back to Banner to sign off on her records release to the new physician  the nurse/assistant asked if she should still submit for that drug approval through our insurance.  This was a week after she had her appointment complaining about the pain.. So basically  they just sat on it  and did nothing while she was in pain.  They didn't even do what they said they were going to do.  This is extremely frustrating and was the final straw.  \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and find a better team of physicians for your family's needs.  That's what we're doing now.  A family doctor should actually care about their patients  and even though I'm sure there are some very good people that work there  there seems to definitely be a systematic flaw in how they do business and treat people.  \\n\\nBut hey... don't take my word for it... go check out their FB page and the bad experiences posted there... I guess we're not alone.",

The total was $21.12. They have lots of neat old electronics decorating the inside  from old console TVs to 8-track players and even an old projector and a ViewMaster! Cool stuff!\\n\\nThe pizza was cut into squares. I don't know why  since this is traditionally done with a square pizza  not a round pizza. The problem is that it makes it quite messy to eat and because there are so many more slices as a result  when the person cutting the pizza doesn't press down hard enough on the pizza cutter  what you really have is a 'suggestion' of where the cuts are  requiring a knife to actually cut the crust and separate the pieces  over and over and over and over again.\\n\\nThe pizza would be easier to eat if if were cut traditionally  and wouldn't be as messy. But that doesn't matter if it tastes good.  However  this pizza was not bad  but it was not what I consider to be 'good ' either.\\n\\nThe crust  cheese and pepperoni were excellent. The sauce tasted flat  almost like something was missing. My wife thought it tasted salty. I didn't notice a salty taste  but I predict it was coming from the pepperoni.\\n\\nThey used fresh mushrooms  but they didn't seem to have the same flavor or texture as fresh mushrooms typically have on a pizza  but that may be because of how they cut them or how 'fresh' they actually were.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place and I left disappointed. \\n\\nIf this was my pizza place  I would offer a 'tangy' pizza sauce  I would cut the pizza traditionally and I would offer garlic powder in addition to grated Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper shakers they currently offer.\\n\\nThey brag nothing has changed since 1961 with regards to how they make their pizza. If this is how it was in 1961  I'm glad I wasn't alive back then. Sometimes change is good! Better yet  offering customers choices is even better. Would it be a big deal to offer a 'white' pizza or other types of sauces? The cost would be low and the variety would be increased ten-fold.\\n\\nIt has promise  but I doubt I'll be seeing any changes given how they brag they haven't ever changed  so I have no reason to go back and try them again.\\n\\nI have to remember not every restaurant in Michigan is great  but I was hoping this was one of them. Sadly  I was wrong.\\n\\nPS - Friendly staff but the location is a bit hard to find since it's buried in a crowded  multi-strip mall and only faces traffic heading one direction  so if you're coming from any of the other three possible directions  it cannot be seen from the road and there are several shopping centers on each corner  so good luck picking the right one to drive around to find it.",

She loves the sermons and the fact that this parish uses Aramaic within their masses. The church is nestled within a neighborhood  where there is still development going on. The hall is quite large  while the church is somewhat in transition as it is just a huge bungalow (the parish is raising money to build a nice church). But the decor of the church-bungalow was not your typical Roman Catholic design. The stone work reminded my grandmother of Jerusalem (where she happened to travel back in the day for a pilgrimage)  while the use of incense was abundant throughout the mass. Most of the parishioners were Filipino  Italian  Lebanese  Hispanic and Indian. \\n\\nIt was my first Aramaic-English mass that I've ever attended.

I had a groupon deal for a mani and pedi for half price so I mapped the address and ended up in what I thought was an abandon building.  Low and behold this deserted complex actually had Naughty Nails on the 2nd level.  Once inside the salon was actually really nice but completely patron-less.  So Wednesday afternoon is very slow here . . . .\\n\\nThere was only one girl working and she very pleasantly greeted me and instructed me to find a color.  I've had countless manicures and I could tell immediately she was not very experienced  but I figured everyone had to gain experience so I was fine with her taking extra time and she let me check in on yelp for free gel nails even with a groupon deal.  She was very nice and we actually had a nice conversation but I didn't feel it appropriate that she told me that most of the salon's customers were coming from the Living Social and Groupon deals and it's always slow in the salon and that she was looking for a new salon to work at.  \\n\\nAs the nail tech is finishing up my gels another girl comes into the salon but she is not a patron and most likely an employee or friend of my nail tech.  Regardless of who she was she was inappropriately dressed in skimpy pajama clothes and looked like she just rolled out of bed from a wild and crazy night.  The girls chatted about the previous nights activities and lets just say the conversation was not appropriate in terms of language or content.  Mind Blown!!  Lets just say I'm glad the mystery girl got a phone call and left as I was moved into the pedicure room.  \\n\\nAs far as the pedicure is concerned I was not impressed.  There is no massaging chair or jets in the \\\"\"\"\"kitchen sink\\\"\"\"\" you put your feet in.  Unfortunately she was even less experienced with pedicures than manicures and didn't even remove the calluses or do a massage with lotion.  She didn't even separate my toes prior to painting so the paint doesn't smear.  Simple tissue paper could of easily been used but nothing!  While the manicure took forever it ended up looking decent  the pedicure lasted about 10 minutes and was not so good.  \\n\\nBest Part: Yelp check in for gel nail upgrade.\\n\\nLate Night Hours: I would consider giving this place another chance since I did also discover in our conversation that they offer late night services by appointment and I absolutely love pedicures at 3am after a long night of working.\\n\\nNeeds Work On:\\nRoad sign since the building looks vacant.\\nEmployee chat about customer service Do's and Don'ts\\nPedicure procedure lasting longer than 10 minutes\\n\\nBest Gel Nails: Fast forward 3 weeks and my gel nails are still perfect.

I figured I was moving to Portland there would have to be something that was a little bit like it. I. could. not. have. been.  more. wrong. It was kind of like hoping if I squinted my eyes the easter bunny could be Santa Claus. You just can't make a stupid bunny look like Santa Claus. So here I sit in a wasteland of crappy spinning classes and weird yoga. \\n\\nBut here's the good news. If you're reading this  there is a high chance you're considering going to Madison because you have the opportunity to do so. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ON HERE?! GO!!!!!!!! Put your silly inhibitions away about it not being the kind of people you're used to. They will all be super skinny and totally in shape and you think you're fat and blah blah blahhhhhhhhhh. Someone will always be something more than you are. But I can tell you the people who run MIC.  They don't care. They really don't. They were also smart enough to cultivate instructors who don't care either. That and it's dark so it's not like you gotta look at anyone anyway. \\n\\nIt's worth it. Really and truly it is. A fun upbeat work out and an intangible...something. You are not going to find it anywhere else (trust me on that I've about ripped Portland apart to find something even kind of like it). I miss it and namaste aside I kind of want to give you a wet willy because you can go.  A bit of advice if you're thinking about going during peak hours. Sign up online save yourself some trouble. Other than that  go with a open mind. Leave your insecurities at the door and have a good time. And don't give me any crap about the price. You get what you pay for and if you don't believe me may I suggest a spinning class at 24 hour fitness. You'll pay MIC 5 times more than what they ask just you never have to deal with that indescribable pain ever again.",

Lets run our hands through the Pant aisle at full speed  and discuss Nordstrom Rack:\\n\\n~What to do~\\nBuy buy buy clothes  shoes  perfumes  accessories  etc... ALL at significantly marked down prices.\\n\\n~The Good~\\nTHEY HAVE PENGUIN! I love....love...love this brand. I am not a clothes person persay  but holy God I love this brand. They have it marked way down  at prices which allow me to comfortably stock my closet. The prices for all the designer clothes  for that matter  are outstanding. I was giddy with excitement looking at all the magnificent deals. Everything I got was at least 50% the normal dollar  rate in regular stores or online! I picked around and was able to come out of the store with everything my heart wanted. The selection is outstanding and they do not skimp on the name brands or styles. Everyone is accounted for  and the styles are not the slightest bit garish. Also  service is fast  even with long lines. They are efficient with your time spent in the store in mind. \\n\\n~The Bad~\\nAlthough they are still marked down  the shoe selection is still pricey. I do not suggest buying the shoes  you can go online or to a shoe store to get better deals. Maybe try on the shoes you are looking for  but put them back and save your money. The jeans are also pretty expensive. I am not a jeans guy  so the dollar amounts for the jeans seemed excessive. I am pretty sure I can get the same quality jeans for a quarter of the price somewhere else. I obviously can't vouche for the womens side  they have a ton... so no comment there. That really covers it  not too bad if you ask me.\\n\\n~The Down Low~\\nAll this said  there are many places to get marked down clothes at. I did my homework  the prices here beat markdowns online and even on E-bay for my Penguin brand. The same goes for a lot of brands  I am sure. For designer styles at marked down prices  this is the perfect spot  and its so close to my place. As for my 4-star rating  the strong variety of options  good looking clothes  large list of designer brands  and the quick efficient service keeps this place with a high rating. The poor prices on shoes and jeans knock a star off. I highly recommend shopping here. Why waste your money with markups!?! Come here  and enjoy!\"",

They have been around 65 years by serving a delicious style of popcorn where they hot air pop the kernels that they mix with their own recipe. Perhaps the secret to their longevity is that they live their mission statement :\\n\\n     \\\"\"\"\"Garrett Popcorn strives to deliver to its loyal clientele hand-crafted  small batch gourmet popcorn.  We serve our loyal following by creating an unparalleled popcorn experience one kernel at a time.\\\"\"\"\" \\n\\n      Perhaps it is their choices of delicious flavors. Flavors that includes Macadamia Caramel Crisp   Pecan Caramel Crisp  Almond Caramel Crisp  Buttery  Plain  and famous Chicago Mix. The Chicago Mix is their signature item. It is a delicious mix of Caramel Crisp and Cheese Corn. But on account of a lawsuit the name is expected to change to the Garrett Mix. \\n\\n   A major ingredient to Garret Popcorn's success is that they have been popping quality. They make the popcorn fresh daily. It is popcorn that is preservative free  gluten free  contains zero transfat  non-GMO kernel free  features whole grains  and a delicious taste. \\n\\n  In the summer of 2012  I was introduced to Garrett Popcorn in an uncommon way. In the cab headed to the hotel  we breathed in an overpowering candied smell over Ontario Street. What was it? The cabbie informed us it was Garrett Popcorn and we had to try it. Garrett Popcorn is so well liked in Chicago it is sometimes alluded to in jest as the cracks of Chicago. A few hours later  we stepped in the Long line toward Garrett. I brought a large bag for nighttime snacking. At first I thought it was overated. After dabbling in the popcorn bag every night it grew on me. It became a nighttime friend. When vacation ended I lost a friend. Or so I thought. \\n\\n  A week after Chicago   I am walking through Miracle Mile when I saw a sign of being reunited with my new friend. The sign said \\\"\"\"\"Garrett Popcorn coming soon.\\\"\"\"\" \\n\\n  The separation lasted longer than I thought. After my summer of 2014 Chicago vacation we'd become friends again. With the hot summer Vegas temp  I'd been visiting Garrett Popcorn each week the past month. \\n\\n  How appropriate I delight in Chicago popcorn as I write Chicago reviews. I love the Chicago Mix. I feel like the child I was decades ago dabbling in a Crunch Berries box.\\n\\n  This Garrett does a shadow of business as the Ontario Street shop. There is a short wait. The employees are friendly and offer samples. There are numerous sizes. To keep a good thing going further into the week I buy the large bag. It costs $8 & change. What differentiates it from many businesses on the Strip is that their value is equal to or better than the local shops I've been to.  \\n\\n  When I finish this bag who knows if Garrett will be a consistent nighttime friend. When the cool weather hits Vegas I might be visiting the Strip less for time in the Great Outdoors. But we'll see. I am just going to take life one pop at a time.\"",

Now  it's got a ton of playing field  basketball courts  kids playground type jungle gyms  bathrooms  a cool little walk circuit  nice layout  and most importantly-a dog park!\\n\\nNow I don't have a dog  but I love to go to parks and watch other people's dogs having fun. Nothing makes my lunch time go faster than grabbing some to go  and stopping and parking and watching the dogs in the dog park. If there aren't any dogs present  I like to watch people doing sports or what not in the main field areas. \\n\\nThe park is still relatively new  and hasn't succumbed to any major graffiti or vandalism  so that's good-hopefully it stays that way. There are a few picnic areas with shade-but I definitely recommend bringing some sunglasses if your going to be here for a while and do the walking trail. \\n\\nSome of the paths don't seem well thought out  and it seems like people cut through some of the areas to get to the bus or other places on the Tropicana side  but I don't use them that much-I just noticed other people doing that. \\n\\nNot sure if there is security  but I probably wouldn't come here after dark just because of the area  but all in all  great job by the city utilizing the space for good instead of building more warehouses or something. \\n\\nCheers!\\n\\n~MikeB",

Great location for walkers  inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2)\\n2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back  only to find it empty  thought to myself  'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too.\\n3. In response to my request for a drink list  our server replied  \\\"\"\"\"We have every beer you can think of in bottle.\\\"\"\"\" False.

A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is NOT an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip.

There is a wide selection of rolls and the ones I and a friend tried were tasty  especially the Lobster Crunch roll. Yes  they can over do the Ponzu sauce a bit so you might ask for your rolls without or very light on the sauce. The rolls are big and there are no half orders (I didn't see this as an option at least) so order what you are going to eat. Also a great selection of items on the menu aside from Sushi. The grilled pork belly was very good and served sizzling on a hot platter. I also enjoyed the Tempura Calamari. Served as strips and not over done and chewy as rings tend to be.\\n\\nWe went on a week night  not crowded and we sat at the Sushi bar. The chefs and wait staff  were friendly but I can see it might get hectic if the place is full since they were light on wait staff.  So get your initial order in and then when you are looking to order more don't think about 1 item at a time. For the AYCE they give you 1 1/2 hours which should be more than enough time to satisfy your Sushi fix. \\n\\nThey have specials written up on the board that are not part of the AYCE  so be aware of that.

I go up to the counter again  the same gentleman asks what I need  tells her yet again and they actually start a mini argument right in front of me about how busy she is and can't grab the drinks! The drive thru may have been busy but it was dead inside with only one other customer  who also did not get their drinks after they ordered. That's got to be fixed  it doesn't take but 30 seconds for her to grab a cup and ice.\\n\\nThe restaurant was also pretty dirty  all the tables were visibly greasy and had either salt or some sort of trash on them.

I'd eat Guthrie's again simply cause the food was decent and the price is great  but when I do go back  it will definitely be a drive thru visit only!\"",

While I had hoped to first experience their dinner service earlier during their opening week  the timing didn't work out. However  I was able to visit for Brunch on their first open Sunday. I was very exciting to see what exactly Derek and co. had in store.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in the heart of plateau Mont Royal in a relatively residential area. The bar dominates the decor and with good reason as it is absolutely beautiful. You also get a nice open view of the kitchen from both inside the restaurant (just outside of the frame to the left) and from the window outside the restaurant. The steady stream of alternative music added to a relaxed friendly and slightly hip vibe.\\n\\nNo menus are handed to you here - everything is posted on a board for all to see. Our waitress kindly informed us of this fact and mentioned the few items she had gotten to try... They'd only had one service previous to our visit  so quite understandable. The menu is a nice mix of classic brunch items with some twists  some typical English breakfast items and more eclectic fare. To start off  I ordered the apple strudel. Nice and flaky with a delicious apple filling  it was a good start to the meal.\\n\\nNext up  I ordered the breakfast sandwich. A sausage patty covered with melted cheese  topped with a egg and maple syrup  all between the housemade English muffin. You are left with a very tasty and satisfying sandwich. The English muffin in particular was quite nice.\\n\\nMy sister  on the other hand. ordered the pancakes with pear butter and smoked bacon. Very nice and fluffy pancakes  all perfectly cooked. The pear butter was a nice and subtle touch to the dish and the bacon had a great smokiness as you would expect.\\n\\nAll in all  a very successful brunch and this was their first weekend. I only except things to get better and better. In general  good brunch places are hard to find so to see a new option enter the scene - especially in my neck of woods - is a wonderful thing. Everyone looking for a great brunch will be in for a great treat if they visit Maison Publique. I hope to have a review of their dinner options shortly - this experience has only made me more eager to come back for more.\\n\\nCheers!",

It's open and bright but I still had a claustrophobic feeling the whole time here. \\n\\nThe menu is very limited and more limited than the picture of a menu posted a while back.\\n\\nI tried the chicken shawarma plate that came with two sides and picked what they called spicy carrot salad and eggplant. The chicken was moist dark meat that differed from other shawarma I tasted because it was more almost nutty tasting and less of that tang taste that some shawarma has. The portion was monstrous as I ate a bunch my husband ate some and I took over 4 oz home. Maybe they just wanted to use up that batch and let it all go on me? I don't know? The eggplant was tasty and tasted like you fried onions with eggplant in a pan. The carrots were skillfully chopped into the tiniest cubes and seemed to taste a bit like coriander but weren't spicy but flavorful. I liked the spicy sauce that came with the plate it wasn't too spicy but was very flavorful and it was long and lingering and interesting.\\n\\nBoth of us were blown away with the beef kabob. It tasted better than we were expecting so it was a pleasant surprise. It tasted like the juiciest better tasting burger you can imagine. A thin nice sear and very moist lightly packed beef that was very good. My husband said if we ever go back he will try a hamburger from here. The kabob plate came with two sides and my husband picked fries and salad. The Fries were COLD AND SOGGY and might have been leftovers from the large take out order before us. The salad was finely diced tomatoes and cucumbers that they call Israeli Salad but according to Wikipedia Arabs also call this salad Arab Salad and Palestinians call this salad Palestinian Salad so it seems the Mid East is also fighting for bragging rights over this salad.\\n\\nOur waiter offered us some pita bread with tehini. I have to say time froze and stopped  still for a second when we tasted the pita. It was that good  I don't know how you make a simple pita taste that good but it was. It was fresh warm very light but strong in texture. My husband isn't really crazy about any shawarma from anywhere but even he said the chicken on this pita was delicious.\\n\\nI took home my left over chicken home and a few sauces and ordered a few felafel's to go. They are green inside and that is an indication of a better felafel that is made with fresh herbs instead of dry. The felafel's didn't have a big crunch but were moist inside and very fresh herby tasting. \\n\\nOur waiter was very thoughtful and just kept trying to bring me more food.\\n\\nSome big hits but the fries were a miss.

The Denver omelette was watery and had too much ham and vegetables that were not properly folded in to the omelette.

They also have a few tables to sit and enjoy a few as well. \\n\\nWe stopped by after eating at food truck Fridays to check it out.  The boys ordered some beers on tap while the ladies got some kombucha out of the fridge to drink.  Kombucha is fermented tea with varying flavors added. Yeah it was new to me too until a few weeks ago.  It is basically non alcoholic with low calories as it is tea after all.  It's perfect for the wife in a beer store  but the whole story on Lenny Boy Kombucha is for another review.  To be honest   I am not sure if you can get beer bottles from the fridge to drink there  but like all other beer places of this type  I would be surprised if you could not. While this place is not near my home  I would not hesitate to return whenever I am in the neighborhood.",

I don't tan or use the massage tables and I rarely bring people with me to work out. But I made a one year comitment to the higher price  which was fine. That was my choice and I can live with cost. The problem came when I tried to downgrade to the $10/month option after my year commitment ended. The gentlman I spoke with told me that I would have to pay a $50 \\\"\"\"\"activation fee\\\"\"\"\" (which was waived when I opted for the year commitment). An \\\"\"\"\"activation fee\\\"\"\"\" after having been a member for 14 months? That's sort of insane after also paying a $40 membership fee each year. When you add in the cost of activation fee and membership fee  I've been paying approximately $28/month. There are plenty of options for health clubs in the $30 range that will even include pools & fitness classes (zumba  yoga  spin  etc.)  which Planet Fitness does not offer. \\n\\nAgain  I think there are many customers who can benefit from the black card membership. I'm simply saying that I don't think it is asking too much that someone who fulfilled the terms of their commitment not be taken advantage of when they are trying to continue their membership at a price that fits his/her needs.\"",

Even the bathrooms were well kept and modern-looking.\\n\\nThe service was also very good.  Our server  Shay  took great care of us.  She was attentive  knowledgeable about the menu and kept our water and tea filled all night without us asking once.

The only problem was the sauce was a little spicy  especially for kids  so my son ended up eating my wife's food instead.  The mac and cheese was average.\\n\\nMy wife and I shared a wedge salad to start and it was the typical wedge  iceberg  blue cheese  bacon and tomatoes but it was good and fairly priced at $5.50\\n\\nMy wife went with the maui ribeye (marinated in soy and pineapple juice).

The baked potato was perfectly cooked and had enough flavor that no S&P was needed.\\n\\nI got several of the appetizers for my entr\\u00e9e (potato fritters  beef carpacchio  and mesquite grilled shrimp).  The potato fritters were good  basically fried balls of loaded baked potatoes served with a semi spicy remoulade.  The beef was okay  needed a little more dressing on the arugula and seasoning on the beef.  The shrimp was the most disappointing  4 grilled shrimp with little flavor and some sort of onion slaw that didn't go well with the shrimp.  I found myself dipping the shrimp in the potato remoulade and it was much better.\\n\\nThe place was a little pricey but the groupon made it a more than fair deal.

I was there a couple days ago  waiting my turn (over an HOUR) to get a polish change (feet). I would've went to my regular nail salon but since they were closed and I was already inside Fashion Show  I decided to go here. BIG MISTAKE!! So when a \\\"\"\"\"manicurist\\\"\"\"\" (from what I hear some of them aren't even licensed) asked me if I'd been helped I pointed to the black girl that I had spoke w/ earlier. She asked if I had an appt and I said no. She said they only go by appts. I WAS LIVID. The one thing you should never do is waste somebody's time. So I waited until the black girl was finished w/ what she was doing and demanded why she didn't tell me about the appt rule. She claimed she did  but what she did was ask me if I wanted to leave my phone # and they'd call me when a chair was free. Since I had nothing to do I told her I'd wait. NOT ONCE did she explain their \\\"\"\"\"protocol\\\"\"\"\" about going off of appts so when I called her out on it she decided to get RUDE  UNPROFESSIONAL and ARGUE w/ me... in front of her customers and all!! Unbelievable! And when I asked for the owner's information she refused to give it to me. Then I asked what her name was and she refused to give me that also... WHAT!?? I told her I would be notifying mall management and get her boss' info from them (which I did). \\n\\nOh and as a side observance (before all of the above happened) a customer came back because evidently she had her nails done earlier that day and the polish was already starting to chip off so she wanted it redone (I don't blame her either).\\n\\nBottom line  SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to a real nail salon! These people are NOT customer friendly and from what I saw their product isn't that great. So glad I didn't waste my $$\"",

This place is the brainchild of Bread & Butter's  culinary genius Chef Chris Herrin. It is located just a hop skip and jump away from the bakery.\\n\\nThe focus on this place is serving homestyle dinners which consists of your choice of meat and 3 sides  hence Meat and Three!! Comfort food Southern style!\\n \\nYou place your order and pay at the counter  seat yourself  server brings out your food.\\n\\nThe Food - Menu above the wall divides the list into four sections: variety of meats  then your choice of 3 sides:  cold or hot sides and pudding cup flavors. If your carb conscious like me you'll love that you are not just limited to potatoes either. You can choose any 3 sides you want.\\n\\nI chose to have the glazed root veggies  fresh fruit and chocolate/nutella pudding cup and Beef Brisket my meat choice. My side orders were served in colorful ramekins.  The Beef Brisket was served on a separate plate and was a pretty generous portion enough to feed 2! The savory juices made it fork tender. Combined with the root veggies  it was a perfect hearty meal. The puddin cup was the perfect size  rich and creamy chocolate.  \\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my meal. It is a good value for what I paid. I'm just concerned for families w/younger children. It can get steep paying the set price.  Would be cool if they had a more affordable price structure set for families on certain days. Like a Sunday Family dinner nite (hint hint)\\n \\nService - Friendly and my order came out pretty quickly.\\n  \\nAtmosphere - Casual  country chic interior  the DIY wall art gives it a special kind of charm  table seating consists of separate tables & chairs for 2 or 4  banquette bench seating along the wall  communal/cafeteria style picnic table in center of dining area for larger parties  or the more sociable bunch. Seating out in front of restaurant if you want to dine Al Fresco. \\n\\nLooking forward to the official launch and many more meals here!",

Got the menu in the mail and figured they've had enough time to have their act together so my wife ordered takeout for me to pick up on the way home from work.\\n\\nThey've opened up the Abacus layout into one large room and added a large sushi bar across from the old drinks bar.  It's well lit but plain  with little decoration.  Only a couple of diners there when I arrived around 6:30 but it still took several minutes of standing at the unattended front desk before anyone helped me  and then a few more to sort out I was there to pick up food.  (Is this a new concept?)\\n\\nPortions were generous: hot & sour soup  lettuce wraps  chicken salad  orange chicken with white rice were much more than enough for two but we wanted to try several things.  Everything looked fine but ... there's a reason why most points on Iron Chef are given for flavor; it should be the most important element in every dish.  I will say PG was remarkably consistent: every dish was pretty much flavor-free.  Not just not the flavor you might expect from other times you've had the same dish elsewhere  but pretty much no flavor at all.  No seasoning  no spices  no hot  no sour  no citrus  no zing  no interest.  (Oh  except for the little containers of light-brown \\u00fcber-wasabi dressing that came with the wraps and salad.  A few seriously intense drops cleaned my sinuses  but otherwise  you guessed it: no flavor.)  Plenty of leftovers remain we can try to rescue with seasoning another night.\\n\\n I know it's still a new place and maybe there's kinks to work out.  We'll go back some time to give them a second try  but only on the principle that one data point doesn't establish a trend.

I dig the ambiance and the drive through pick up lane and am betting this concept multiplies quickly.

Yes I am serious. It is in fact the best \\\"\"\"\"hidden gem\\\"\"\"\" in Las Vegas. Apparently it has only been open for 3 months which explains why there are few reviews  but I promise you this place will blow up. Let 's get started.\\n\\n    I litteraly wanted to try every appetizer they had however I asked our waiterss (Nicole) if she had choice of trying every single appetizer OR trying 3 of them and a steak which would she do? She replied \\\"\"\"\" Apps & steak\\\"\"\"\". I took her advice... and was I glad I did!!\\n\\n\\nAppetizer(s)\\n\\n1. Applewood Bacon Jalapeno Prawns  5 Stars  wonderfull! Flavorfull and delicous a solid choice!\\n\\n2. Lobster Cake  4 stars. It was good not exceptional  but very good.\\n\\n3. PBJ Baggeutte with Bacon & Blue Cheese. Well words cannot describe this item. It is litteraly one of the best things I have ever eaten. So good in fact I ordered 2 of them  I am not ashamed to admit it! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not be discouraged by this item!! If you like blue cheese you will like this item!! I am a meat and potatoes guy  I really don't do much \\\"\"\"\"exotic\\\"\"\"\" stuff. trust me when I say  This item is legendary! 5 stars\\n\\nEntree(s)\\n\\n1. Fish and chips. 4 stars  very good but I am not a sweet potatoe fry fan  if I were it may get 4.5 stars. The Tartar sauce that came with it is excellent (my mother had this  I only had a couple bites)\\n\\n2. Twin Lobster tails. 5 stars. It's hard to mess up lobster tails. LOL. These were a decent size and cooked perfectly. ( My sweetie had this  again only a few bites)\\n\\n3. Ribeye Steak. 5 Stars. The key to this ladies and gents is to get the blue cheese butter!! AGAIN  GET THE BLUE CHEESE BUTTER! This was quite simply delicious!! Amazing steak! And they cook steak medium plus!! ( that's in between medium and medium well for those that don't know)\\n\\nSides\\n\\nCorn on the Cob squares? Not sure on the techical name on these  but basically they are corn on the cob  grilled  sliced down the center and put into quarters. The have it with some spicy peppers so these have a kick!! However they were great! 5 stars\\n\\nMashed Potatoe Croquttes. Excellent cooked perfectly! Very tasty! 5 Stars! You only get 3 in an order though.\\n\\nDesert\\n\\nWell... I dare not even write about it  this was a \\\"\"\"\"special item\\\"\"\"\" that is only served on Christamas day! I don't want to get anyones hopes up only to not be able to try it. It was in my top 3 desserts I have ever had in my life! Yes  in my life!!! They will be having it back next year for Christmas  and  I will be there. I was threatened at gunpoint by my mother if I didn't take her back here. And if you were wondering... I ordered two of these as well :) LOL.\\n\\n\\nIn a nutshell this place was beyond my hopes and dreams! If your a local this is one of the few reasons to travel to the strip! If your not local you have to go here before going back home! Trust me  you won't regret it!!! The prices for a steakhouse on the strip are VERY reasonable! They could charge double for thier items easily.\"",

Crackling calamari was disgusting. The squid was bland and overly oily. The spicy aioli was pretty much just mayo. The lollipop chicken wings were the best thing taste wise  but the chef needs to learn how to properly prepare these. Requires more than just scraping the top part of the flesh from the bone.\\n\\nGiven we ordered a salad for dinner here  so I wasn't expecting much. The chopped chicken salad was a joke. The ingredients didn't taste fresh  pretty sure the mushrooms and olives were from a can. The chicken was massacred and thrown at the bottom so you could see the poor knife skills. The Caeser Salad was sheer ridiculousness. Frankly if you can count the individual amount of Parmesan cheese in your salad on one hand  there is an issue. The dressing only tasted of mayo. \\n\\nWish we did not come here to eat. I would avoid any of these items if you come here. I say again however  service was great.",

While I do agree that this place is super sleek  posh  well decorated  and the kind of place that attracts beautiful people  the absolutely horrible service destroyed any chance that my party and I were going to have a good night there. \\nWe were a party of 12 out for a bachelorette party and this was our first stop. We ordered 12 shots and the female bartender informed us that the bottle was only $145. It wasn't...she did not tell us it was $175 all in with tax. Fine. I could have forgiven this as a miscommunication  however when we went to pay for our bottle we did not leave a tip...because literally all the woman did was take the bottle off the shelf and hand it to us. Since we were planning on being there a while we planned on tipping in the usual manner if leaving a few bucks on the bar per drink. 5 minutes after paying the bartender came up to us and proceeded to lambast us  noting that the tip was not included in the  bill. She DEMANDED more  money...and continued to demand more money. Additionally  none of the other bartenders would pay any attention to us. I asked for a salt shaker for my tequila and one if them literally rolled their eyes. However  when groups of men came to the bar they were more than happy to shake their barely covered ta tas in an effort to squeeze a little more cash out if them.  12 girls  obviously unimpressed  apparently weren't worth the effort. If you enjoy being like they're doing you a favor for serving you  by all means come to this place. But Montreal has so many great places...to me its not worth it.",

I highly RECOMMEND the Chasu bowl (pork and white rice  with ginger). It's so delish and it too is full of flavor. It has a very subtle sweetness to it which I love and is also very tender and nicely marinated.

This place definitely reminds me of a person who thinks that they are wayyyyy hotter than they really are. \\n\\nFood was a 3  service and overall experience was a 1  so landed on a 2 rating. Would not recommend. Full review below - \\n\\nEarlier in the week  my wife called to ask a question about our reservation. She was promptly told we didn't have one (we did) and was hung up on. Delightful. Should have been red flag #1.\\n\\nWhen we walked in and the hostess seated our party (spoiler - the reservation we actually had)  the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the modified wine bottles that were used as drinking glasses.\\n\\nDrinks - Beer list was solid and definitely above average for the area. I settled on Dogfish's Festina Peche which seemed refreshing given the recent heat/humidity combo. Going rate for the beer was $7. When it came back from the bar  I noticed that I received it in a beer snifter glass which holds about 10oz. Looked around and noticed that other people in my party had the same pour. Now  I have no problem paying (and have more than I should) $7  $10  $12 for a 10oz pour of a higher alcohol by volume or rare seasonal beer. But $7 for a 10oz (really 8oz since mine was short poured and spilled on the table) fairly standard seasonal that has an ABV of 4.5%? The blatant money grab on the drinks is not a good look.\\n\\nFood - As happy hour was ending  I decided to order the Chef's Charcuterie board. This was easily the best thing I had. Seemed like an assortment of pickled veggies and an egg with bread  jam and 3 kinds of meat. I can't tell you exactly what was on the board because the waiter just dropped it off in front of me with zero explanation and walked away. For the main course  there really wasn't anything innovative or unique on the menu  so I settled on the pot roast because I was craving it for some reason. Tots were easily the best thing on the plate. Pot roast was kinda bland  definitely needed salt. Aioli didn't really add much and didn't really make all that much sense from a flavor profile in my opinion.\\n\\nA group of us (11) try a new place every month. This month happened to fall on a birthday. So  we brought some cupcakes as is the tradition. Waiter tells us that in order to serve them in the restaurant  we have to pay $4 a head. When we protest to the manager  he tells us it is a health code violation. So...it's a food safety risk unless we pay you $4 a head? Word of advice  the money grab is bad for business. 11 people who had been there for 2 hours now will not order another $7-12 drink ($77 is more than $44  shocking I know) and will leave with a bad feeling about your place. Not smart.\\n\\nOverall  food is ok  service is bad  drink situation will make you feel like you need a shower. Spend your time and money somewhere else and thank me later.

Greg  another one. What are these animals? Used car salesmen? Initially I called them to find out if a color cabinet I wanted was really going to be discontinued  or if another company was just trying to rush me into buying. When I originally called  someone answered and said all the salespeople were out of the office  but to email him the image of what I wanted and the quote I got because there was NO DOUBT they couldn't be beat. (RIGHT) I called back on Monday to find out if my image was received and Greg was trying to argue that the person I KNOW I had spoke to was off that day so it was impossible. Actually arguing back and forth with me telling me I was wrong. Anyhow  I just needed an answer to see if the cabinets were going to be discontinued. Whatever. He called me back and said that he was wrong (duh) and the guy who I spoke with was actually in the warehouse that day and I did speak to him. (No shi*t really?) Anyway  he said that the color I wanted really is going to be discontinued. He then told me to give him a little bit and he will get me a quote. I told him it would be easier if he had someone come out and measure because all I gave him was an auto cad drawing of someone else's design. He said he could figure it out base on the photo and if I liked the price he would send someone out to double check. However  he knew what I had. So I let him run with it. He calls me back the next day and tells me that it was almost 6k. I said that's impossible  how is it almost a thousand dollars more? And he said well you have 36 inch cabinets. I said no they are 30 inch cabinets. He said they look really tall to be 30 inch cabinets. So I said I work around the corner I will go home and measure them on my lunch break. So I did  I called him back and said they are 30 inches. I don't know what is wrong with this guy and his constant need for confirmation. He must have been abandoned as a child or something. He says ok  that will definitely change the price and he will call me back. So he calls me back AGAIN and tells me \\\"\"\"\"forty-eight-eighty-eight\\\"\"\"\" I said excuse me? he said $4 888. I said ok. That's only about $150 cheaper but I will come in anyway and I made an appointment for tomorrow (Saturday) at 10am. Now  my husband will be at work tomorrow  so he asked for a quote since he couldn't come. He emailed Greg yesterday  and finally got one today at 5pm. Now this $4 888 turned into $5 886. So naturally  I call and ask why is it a thousand dollars more than he quoted me? He said It was originally $6888 I said no it wasn't. Why would I even bother making an appointment if you were 2 grand more than another company? Then he said look I'm not going to argue with you here. And I said you're right. You're not and I hung up on him. Then I called back and decided to ask for the store manager. Another animal named Nick. I start complaining about how the attitude I got from Greg was disgusting and I don't know who he thinks he was talking to and it was an embarrassment that he represents Cardell  and I would be calling them. Then he starts to laugh and says are you finished yelling? Oh  I wasn't yelling. Believe me. I said you think I am a joke? I want the phone number to the owner of the company. Then he laughs again and said there is no owner of the company. So I replied is this is a joke to you? What is so funny? I will go out there and chew you up! Then I hear silence. He hangs up on me! Now I am really mad. I call back and ask for the owners name and he said ma'am I'm going to cal the cops you said you were going to shoot me up and hangs up again. What animals. Shoot you up. Well thank you for insulting my accent on top of that. These beasts are like used car salesmen or even worse... Time share consultants. Try to bring you in and trap you. Go elsewhere! 8 complaints from this store alone within a year from BBB  and a blank section on about us on their website. Yeah.. There is nothing about you. You're worthless.\"",

Enchiladas and Soup is a new place that I keep seeing mentioned on all the best-foods-in-Phoenix type lists.\\n\\nI ordered two tacos. My husband ordered enchiladas. I chose the \\\"\"\"\"50/50 \\\"\"\"\" meaning half flour and half corn tortillas--this ended up being a good choice  because my husband went with corn and found they became extra toasty in the oven. \\n\\nNext up... MEAT. I was a bit confused about if I could combine meat with another non-meat main item  and it turned out I could.\\n\\nI chose to do two chicken and cornbread tacos. Cornbread. YES. Scooped out of a big casserole pan. Yelp said it was delicious  so I wanted to give it a shot!\\n\\nWith my tacos girded with chicken and chunks of cornbread  my food moved on down the food bar. Me  I love me some cheese  and here I asked for asadero and chihuahua cheese. My whole dish was stuck in the big oven to heat up for like two minutes as I waited and drooled. Next up  I asked for pico  crumbled cojita cheese (because cheeeeeeeese)  vinaigrette slaw  and pickled onions. At this point  the dish looked like a delicious rainbow of awesomeness.\\n\\nI asked for a pumpkin cookie and was pleased that the order included two. BONUS COOKIE FTW. They also had lemon blueberry cookies and I'd love to try those sometime.\\n\\nSo  cornbread on a taco. Dude. This is amazing. Cornbread tastes awesome but it also has this soft/crunchy texture thing going on. It melds with the meat. Clouds opened up. Angels sang. Cornbread is good with everything on a Thanksgiving plate  and it totally works with zingy Mexican flavors. I need to try this combo at home.\\n\\nThe food was 100% awesome. Every topping I chose was fabulous. The slaw and onions added a tang and crunch that nicely complemented the holy fusion of cornbread and chicken.\\n\\nMy husband had a short rib and a pork enchilada. He was pleased. I asked for bites of his food to judge this. Well  it was more like a mugging. My fork loomed over his plate and he wisely surrendered the dish before I stabbed him. I agreed with his assessment.\\n\\nMeanwhile  our son had tortilla chips. They are awesome  all covered with bubbles  and thick enough that they can crackle and kinda explode when you bite into them. You could tell they are made there.\\n\\nThen we come to the cookies. The glaze on them turned out to be maple. MAPLE! Happiness! Rainbows! Fuzzy kittens! The cookies really tasted like homemade and were soft and chewy.\\n\\nWe loved Gadzooks. Awesome food with great options. Good prices ($6.95 to get two tacos or two enchiladas). It's earned all the buzz.\"",

They took the ice cream off and just handed it to us in a cup (I honestly would have replaced every thing) They proceeded to warm the brownie and burnt it. Then 10 minutes later still no warm brownie. She said the brownie was soft but still chilly and asked if it was okay....I mean I guess we've been waiting a while so nevermind already..the icecream was half melted any way.

The line to get it wasn't bad when we arrived  but our friends came 15 min. later and the line was down the street and around the corner. I'll mention the entrance fee in a min.\\n\\nThe variety of food trucks appeared extensive  however by 6:30 over half were closing up shop and White Castle - oh White Castle...this is the main reason the huz and I decided to go.  A sign greeted us at the entrance that stated they would no longer be serving.  We went in anyway  saw that they were still cooking and people were sitting around - we soon realized that was the 4 HOUR wait - they gave people chairs!  We decided to grab a beer  however almost all was gone  our choices were Miller Light  wine or water!  It seemed so pointless  so I called my friends who were still standing in line and told them not to waste money getting in and we met up for dinner elsewhere.  \\n\\nWhat's appalling to me is the fact that when we left around 7:00  the line was unbelievable and any food trucks still serving had lines and wait times I had no patience for.  I wanted to have a megaphone and let the people waiting in line know that it was a waste  but I refrained.  I can't believe they continued to accept people's money ($10 at that - $8 for military) without letting them know what to expect.

I tried to get clarification and he pointed at my girlfriend and said \\\"\"\"\"she was swaying.\\\"\"\"\"  I thought he was kidding - she hadn't had any more to drink than me - and if she was swaying it was just enjoying the music - and furthermore  if she was the one getting kicked out  why would they tell me to be calling it a night?  It didn't make any sense.  They would just go to her and kick her out - but somehow  they knew we were together and made a point to kick us out together.  This was all before 1am.  \\n\\nAfter assessing our situation and trying to coordinate with the others in our group that were still in the club  I returned one more time to try and ask some questions.  I was completely respectful and just said I didn't understand.  The bouncer got a puffed up  crossed his arms and said it didn't matter why he kicked us out  he could do whatever he wanted - it was private property.  He said if he came to my house and I told him to leave he would have to go - same here.  \\n\\nExcept we paid money to go into the club  and were dismissed before we were able to really even take advantage of it.  If you ask me  it's a brilliant business model - charge people the $100 for drinking and  then kick them out before they can use it.  \\n\\nThere is no explanation for what happened.  We've been trying to figure out if they were just trying to make more room for other people - single people who might spend more money  or if they truly are taking advantage of that arm band and making money off of it.  We certainly weren't drunk enough or behaving in any way to merit it.  \\n\\nI've sent an email and am awaiting a response.  \\n\\nI've never been kicked out of a bar or club before  have always been respectful  and even in this situation  I never raised my voice or caused a problem.

I don't know..it was strange. \\n\\nAll in all  it's just not that much of an upgrade from the regular seating areas outside the club. It wasn't the worst place  but I've experienced better. Which  equates to 2 stars.\"",

I got home and opened the bag to see the chips were drenched in oil. I mean like everytime I touched a chip my fingers were glistening! I will post a pick of the bag of chips an 2hours later. i love homemade chips but they need to lay these out in a draining bin before they bag them. Very disappointing.

I then asked for a side of ranch and that took another 5 minutes.  I was so frustrated and hungry that I actually went up to the kitchen and had to ask for the ranch.

Oregano should enhance the flavor  not BE the flavor! \\n\\nNow  I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible  in my opinion  and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off.

When my mom complained about it on her visit  I thought that was just her age talking (imagine a cranky lady shaking her fist at the kiddos - \\\"\"\"\"turn that loud mess off\\\"\"\"\").  \\n\\nWith the busy street on one side and live band that answered back with a higher volume  sound waves bounced chaotically off every inche of the patio - the place is nothing but hard surfaces.  I was literally screaming at my lunch companion as well as the waitress.  I was also in a volume battle with the noisy kids seated just a foot away from us.  Oh yes  there are children there too.\\n\\nAs I left  with a sore throat and ringing in my ears  I decided this was not a place to return.  However  when friends picked the yard later that night  I realized that wouldn't last.\\n\\nAnd it was still loud.  But that seems more acceptable when it is after 10pm...however  I was struggling to continue to yell at my companions and listen carefully with my ear in their face to hear them.\\n\\nSo that was my major take away from my 6 hours at the Yard.  Loud.  In fact  I can still hear it ringing in my ears.\"",

I asked for my wings crispy and they were cooked perfectly crispy on the outside  moist and juicy  and perfectly done on the inside.

The food was ok -- but the service was dreadful. We all got the table d'h\\u00f4te which is $24 for salad  pizza  non-alcoholic drink  and dessert. A good deal! Long story short  the salads never came and ended up being served with the pizza (not a huge deal)  then we never saw the server again. Half our table was cleared at a certain point  but about 30 minutes after that we decided just to go inside to pay. At the register  we reminded her that we had dessert with our meals and she laughed  saying she had totally forgotten. As we paid  she piped chocolate icing into to-go plastic cups and handed them to us. Strange!

The butcher board was fabulous. As we go on with the entrees we were left disappointed. We tried the \\\"\"\"\"exceptional\\\"\"\"\" waffle and chicken. The chicken was too salty and tasted like old chicken. The waffle was not tasty  it came out soggy and fell flat. We then order the super food salad with steak. The salad was okay although the dressing was too runny. The steak was okay was nicely spiced. We then ended the night with some ice cream  they claimed was hand crafted. The ice cream tasted like store brought ice cream. The service was 5 stars too bad the quality of the food fell short. Really thought this place was going to be a hit.\"",

This place had me calling that *other* new nightclub in Vegas \\\"\"\"\"Wakkasan.\\\"\"\"\" I went here with a group of friends.  The dudes purchased presale tickets via Light's website (which is the easiest way to get into the club without any drama). The girls were hot and knew a promoter so getting in free for them was easy (as it should be  because let's face it - this is Vegas). The moment you walk into the club  I swear  you feel like Alice going down the rabbit hole.  The place is a complete sensory overload: The entire back wall behind the DJ is a giant LED screen which can also be back-lit to show aerialists and acrobats doing super craze things in the background.  One second you're watching a fairy doing cartwheels and tumbles and next second the screens illuminate in sync with the beat drops  flashing a sick DJ's name (Ingrosso! A-Trak! Zedd!)  There's dozens of \\\"\"\"\"atmosphere\\\"\"\"\" performers who walk around the club in crazy costumes  posing for pictures with people and adding to the spectacle of it all. If you've ever been to an Insomniac rave  it's pretty much like that  except there aren't half naked teenagers and tutus and people trading bracelets with their eyes rolled back. This is a classy establishment but with all the lasers  lights  beats  strobes  confetti  and bubbles (yes! bubbles!) that you could ever ask for. Best part about the club is the trapeze artists that come out every 30 minutes or so. There's nothing quite like dancing with a group of your friends  music blaring  and watching a trapeze artist swing 10 feet above your head. Drink prices are your standard Vegas prices. Can't complain there. The layout is cool. Judging from some reviews I read  people complained about the dancefloor being too small. PLEASE. Unless you're comparing it to XS  there's no way you should be complaining about the dancefloor size. Another cool thing about this place is that though there's tons of security  they're not constantly shining flashlights in your face telling you to keep moving because you're too poor to afford bottle service and because you're too poor to afford table you shouldn't be afforded the right to relax in one place.  I also never had a problem going back and forth between the bar and the dancefloor to find my friends.  It was crowded  but not XS dancefloor crowded and definitely not Marquee crowded.  Light really hit the mark.  Cirque du Soleil x Nightclub collabo was definitely a huge success.  This will probably be the only club I'll ever hit up in Vegas.\\n\\nPros +\\nSee above.\\nAtmosphere  atmosphere  atmosphere!\\nPre-sale line is a breeze.\\n\\n\\nCons -\\nMandalay Bay  Y U SO FAR from everything?\\nNo hip hop room\"",

What made this club for me is the fact that there is actually room on the dancefloor to actually dance. Also loved that A-Trak put on a few current hip hop hits which was refreshing for an edm only club. Of course the lighting and ceiling performers were amazing. If you like to dance this is the place to be. If you wanna pop bottles I'd probably look to make a reservation somewhere else. All in all I had a great time and partied till almost 5am. I'm giving this place 5* because of the dancefloor  being able to figure out which bar had the least wait time to order a drink  figuring the best path to get to the dancefloor without the mass of people in the way and which area of the dancefloor was best.

A beer is $9. This wasn't even a fancy beer I ordered  it was a Guinness. This is expensive for downtown  but would also be expensive for any bar that isn't technically a \\\"\"\"\"club.\\\"\"\"\" I know I've bought a Guinness at bars on the strip for less than $9. Again  this isn't exactly some rare  top-of-the-line microbrew  it's a readily available beer  so I have a hard time paying even $7 for it. But here's the real rub  unlike the bars on the strip  it didn't even look like I got a full pint! I could walk down to the Griffin and get a slightly higher end beer that will  at most cost $7  and I'll be fine with it  because at least it's not a beer I always see on tap at any given bar. Since beers are so expensive here  I've never bothered ordering a specialty drink  maybe they're great  but I'm willing to bet they're also grossly overpriced.\\n\\nI've seen a couple reviews complaining about bartenders  who seemed fine any time I've order from them. I'd say to look out for most of the bouncers - many of them are rude  kinda stereotypical bouncers trying to prove that they're tough guys. Some of them are okay  usually when they're at the door  but other than that I've never had a pleasant experience interacting with them. Speaking of the door... there's a $10 cover charge on weekends... because they aren't making enough money from the overpriced drinks.\\n\\nMaybe all the expense is to cover the interior decorations which aren't bad  I'll give them that.\\n\\nBottom line: Looks alright inside but don't expect to save money compared to just going to any given club on the Strip.

I dug in and found the food temperature barely lukewarm. My entree was nicely flavored with a fairly mild curry sauce and since this was our first meal at Tom Yum I had ordered medium hot and it was spot on for peppery heat. The sliced pork was on the tough side probably due to being cooked at too low a wok temperature thus sweating instead of frying.\\n\\nMy wife tried the cashew pork and her entree arrived (with orange slice) piping hot  the pork was tender and the onion chunks perfectly cooked.

It opened in the space that Ian's Pizza moved out of.  They spent quite a bit of work to completely redo the interior.  They attempted to capture the up north feel  with lots of cedar wood and country decor.   There was a gas fireplace in the middle of the dining room which I really liked.  \\n\\nI got the whitefish hoagie.   The menu said that all sandwiches were served with a side of sweet mustard cole slaw.\\\"\"\"\"   Hmm...I don't remember tasting any mustard  or any sweetness  or anything all.   It was weak  mostly watery cabbage with a touch of cream.    My sandwich was okay.  The red pepper aioli didn't stand out.  I actually thought it was melted cheese until I reviewed the menu just now.  There wasn't any tartar sauce served.\\n\\nThe sides are kind of a rip; especially the traditional fries.  They're a $3 add on and they could've easily been from the frozen section at Woodman's Foods.  \\n\\nOne of my co-workers got the Wild Boar Burger  fries  and a CAN of beer.  His bill was $17 before tip.   Seemed pretty steep for a lunch.  It'd be different if any of the 3 items were standout  but they were lacking.\\n\\nOne co-worker had the grilled cheese sandwich with fig jam & sliced apples.  He was really happy with it.  Out of our group of 5  he's the only one that said he'd come back.\"",

Perhaps not the same people  but you get the idea.\\n\\nWhatever the case  the Singing Christmas Tree is a tradition that is still going strong. Or strongish. There was even a wedding party that has apparently attended the event for 50 years now. But the jury is certainly out on the event itself.\\n\\nNot having attended this particular performance before  I don't know if this is what they usually do  but they seem to have an identity issue. Notably  some songs are performed in their entirety (and then some)  with every verse from the traditional hymnal  with more thrown in as well. Others are abbreviated in American Idol or Glee-esque fashion. It's a mish-mash that doesn't really work that well.\\n\\nThen throw in works like a tribal drum  number (that was one of the better of the night) and the fact that some of the better voices are muted in the tree itself so you can't hear them  and it's definitely something you might not miss if it doesn't see a 59th  year.\\n\\nAt a minimum  they may be better off doing a traditional show for those who want the regular hymns  and a contemporary one for those who  well  don't  rather than trying to mix the two. And for goodness sake  fix the sound and seating issues  as those are just too basic to not have working correctly!",

Butterjoint is not the dive that you love but rather the dive that you never want to go back to.  It has a reputation for making good cocktails  or so I've been told  and I can only imagine that reputation is used to mask a food menu that is uninspired in both design and execution.  I have eaten here twice  once with friends and the other time with my girlfriend.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.\\n\\nAmbiance: See above  I know of hole-in-the-walls just south of Washington Square Park in New York that have more ambiance in the limited curb appeal than this cramped and hot space.\\n\\nService: The service was fantastic the first time I went but I accredit this to the fact that my friends knew the people that worked here.  The second time  without that built-in relationship and rapport  my girlfriend and I were consistently ignored throughout the entire meal.  We were not greeted at the door.  We were not shown to a table.  It took ten minutes before anyone noticed that no server was taking our table  during which time our soon-to-be waitress gave a great big bear hug to  wait for it  someone that she knew.  No silverware was given with our meal.  The list goes on.  The bottom line is that quality of service is not measured by how you treat the regulars but how you perform on a consistent basis with any random customer.  Butterjoint would do well to learn and observe this maxim.\\n\\nFood: I've eaten better burgers at the chain restaurant Five Guys.  The perogies might as well have been Mrs. Ts from the freezer.  And the fries  I don't know how they tasted because they were cold and not worth even trying.  Burgers are an everyman type of food that is genuinely hard to make bad.  Butterjoint is impressive in that respect since it managed to do that very thing.\\n\\nPrice: Unreasonable cost for a burger that tastes like this.  I'd rather go to Five Guys to save money and have a much better burger.\\n\\nThe reputation for good cocktails: I can't speak on it since I ordered a beer; not a cocktail.  Given the aforementioned comments  I have to believe there are other trendy spots in Pittsburgh to quench my alcoholic thirst than this place.  \\n\\nIn summary  if you're hungry look elsewhere.  If you have a craving for a cocktail  I'm sure you can find a place that combines an inviting and comfortable ambiance with tasty concoctions.",

(Bun cha is rice vermicelli with fried spring rolls usually accompanied by seasoned fish sauce in case you are wondering.) Now going to Jenni Pho  Pho being the namesake of the restaurant  you think you would get something that is standard or above par. Not so much. Like opening a can of peanuts and getting snakes instead  I was quickly disappointed and surprised at how disappointing it was. The broth was weak and I felt I could have done better with a packet of ramen. The noodles were alright and the beef was eh. My fiancee's dish didn't far any better. Her vermicelli was cold. Not cold as in it was hot in the window and probably got cold after waiting for a little bit. No. It was cold as in grabbing it from a lowboy cold. The spring rolls were also mediocre at best. Service was not bad and seemed apologetic for the most part. The floors were a little messy and the restaurant having not been busy when we were there  I can only say probably due to laziness. \\n\\nCompeting against other established Pho institutions in Chinatown is rough but at least bring your full game.

It was like a cross between mothballs and burnt wood. The building looked really old  and the inside was clearly outdated. They obviously didn't change a thing when they opened. Their leather menus have the name \\\"\"\"\"Kelly's\\\"\"\"\" in bright neon.. Well actually Kelly green.. The K is backwards and there's a shamrock on the menu. This can be really misleading from the outside  because it looks and sounds like an Irish pub  not a steakhouse. \\n\\nThey have live entertainment from 6-10PM daily. Their idea of entertainment is an older man singing terribly to his piano. I joked with my husband and told him that I felt like I was in a nursing home. \\n\\nFor apps we ordered the steamed Manila clams. I hated them  the sauce was really salty and it tasted like a wine infused BBQ sauce. \\n\\nIn hopes that it would get better we both had the lobster bisque to follow. Again--- overly salty and the bisque tasted like it came from a can. It does come with a generous scoop of lobster though. \\n\\nAt this point  I was just looking forward to our steak. It arrived quickly. The waiter said they marinate them in a nice mixture of oils  salt  pepper etc. He proudly boasted that the steaks were high quality.... they weren't good :-( I love filet mignon. Matter of fact  Ive never had a bad steak night in Vegas  until now! \\n\\nWe also ordered their garlic mashed potatoes  truffled corn and creamed spinach. I'm absolutely sure that they use an instant mashed potato and just add a few fresh potatoes. The consistency was so gritty  you could just tell. The corn did not have truffle oil  or truffle anything. It was creamed corn with a breadcrumb crust on top. As for the spinach  it was watery  not seasoned and undercooked. \\n\\n\\nI've never had a dinner in a restaurant where every aspect of the meal was this bad. This place will not survive with Mortons around the corner and Del Friscos across the street. \\n\\n\\nPros:\\n-The server was so nice  very attentive without being overbearing. \\n-My martini was cold \\n\\nI wish I had more nice things to say  but it was just so terrible.

It also offers balcony seats for patrons 21 or older where you may order drinks throughout the movie or maybe you just want to be served lunch or dinner. \\n   They also offer a bowling alley and arcade room. Now my favorite places of all  The Cone where they serve homemade ice cream daily and the 347 Grill. The rib-bye steak at the Grill is the best I ever had and is only half the price as the Steak House inside the Casino! Just amazing food! A really amazing place!",

I would recommend it. I ordered the chili on the side instead of on top of my sandwich. Good call because I didn't like the chili at all. Everything else we ordered was mediocre. Rib tips weren't very tasty. The sides were a disappointment and here's why - melted styrofoam! Gross! I dumped the baked mac and cheese onto my plate to find the styrofoam cup was melted on the inside! That CAN'T be healthy! Same happened with the sweet potato casserole. Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. The baked beans also came in a styrofoam cup which didn't melt and tasted just ok. I know this place's roots are from a food truck  but it's time to get rid of the styrofoam! It's literally IN my food AND not earth-friendly. And you don't even need the styrofoam! The sides could be placed directly on the plate. Texas toast would be better if they buttered and seasoned BOTH sides of the bread. Fun to see Kool-Aid on the beverage menu and the smoker right out front!

        "text": "\"Although Jennifer was cordial and a pleasure to do pre-planning arrangements with (ie: how many of this/that  what we need  etc.) I was not very impressed with how she conducted business on our wedding date. Our wedding was 150 people  in Beaver Dam  and in my parents back yard. I supplied everything for them (aside from mixing utensils). \\nMy father expressed concern regarding underage drinking and over-intoxication. I understand he had requested that IDs be checked for those appearing to be underage. This is not an unusual request and was part of the reason we'd hired a bartender to handle alcohol rather than have a liqueur buffet. However  requesting the ID of my grown  adult guests repeatedly throughout the night became an issue. By \\\"\"\"\"became an issue\\\"\"\"\"  I mean that myself  the groom and our parents were receiving countless complaints from our obviously-adult guests that they were being refused service at the bar or they felt as though they were treated rudely. A specific situation would be she requests to see the IDs of my grandparents (they're 70+ years old) or our aunts and uncles who are well into their 40s. In fact  looking back at my guest list  there were 16 underage children (not teens) at the wedding. The issue persisted throughout the evening  concluding in my father and the groom having to tell her to ease-up 3 different times. \\nI understand that we hired her and her colleague for the better part of the day. I understand that we hired them both over 2 mealtimes. I made it a point to pass-the-word along that vendors were welcome to help themselves to a plate of food before the caterer left. However  I did not expect that she would serve herself food prior to all of the guests eating and seat herself amongst them. That was not professional in the least. I didn't notice it  but my guests did and they've brought it up to me numerous times. \\nBiggest issue that baffled me was her telling guests (my bridesmaids  groomsmen  and our parents included) that we were all out of various sodas and other alcohol by the end of the night; however  when cleaning up the next day  we carried 20+ 2-liters and 10+ bottles of alcohol out of the ice trailer.  We did not run out of a single thing other than cups. I do not understand why she would tell people we were out of those items. A specific example  we bought a ton of diet soda because there were 3+ guests that are diabetic. One of those guests approached the groom at around 10p stating he was told there was no more diet soda. We had some; we're still finishing 2-liters that were left over today. \\nShe refused service to one of my dearest friends while the groom was ordering her a shot. We bought a special $50 bottle of gluten-free vodka exclusively for her that went to waste because she over-asserted herself. She then proceeded to give the groom himself a mini-sobriety test when he was ordering (ie: asking rapid-fire  unrelated questions  paying close attention to his answer/response time). Guests complained to me about her rudely refusing service unless they brought their original cups back. I understand we ran out a few times  but we had enough (and continuously brought her more) that she didn't need to be turning people down. \\nOn the other hand  we received nothing but compliments regarding her colleague's composure and professionalism throughout the night. In conclusion  hearing the feedback we've received from our guests since the wedding I was unsatisfied with the quality of service she provided. I will not be recommending her business to others.\"",

She asked us what our last name was  in which my fiance replied: \\\"\"\"\"I will just tell you my first name  because my last name is very long  and hard to pronounce.\\\"\"\"\" So he told her his first name  and she preceded to still ask for his last name. My fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her  to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a \\\"\"\"\"Well  it's a 45 minute wait.\\\"\"\"\" I think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling  and pronouncing our last name; which she would have butchered if left to her. \\n\\nAfter that  we went to the bar. I am not a fan at sitting at the bar  but the bartenders were very animated and friendly. They served us our drinks and food quickly. The bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections. We ordered (I don't remember the exact names) the pub sliders  pretzel sticks  and the fish and chips. Me and my fiance share food a lot  and it is a wise idea to do that here because the portions are large. \\n\\nI thought that the food was presented beautifully  and that it tasted good. The pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo  loved it. The pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard (VERY SPICY AND AWESOME)  and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy. \\n\\nWhile we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves  we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum. We also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment. Clearly  doing their job is so exasperating for them. Gosh  they should take a break. \\n\\nI would come here again  and I would recommend it to a friend. I took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses. Ramsay above all people should know that first impressions mean a lot  and that those ladies up front gave us  and from what I'm reading most people  a bad taste in their mouth.\"",

        "text": "We went there for lunch  figured it would be nice to eat in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants  even if it's a cheaper one (well  not really  let's say cheap for Vegas...). So  right off the bat  looking at the menu  I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good  but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu  like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so. \\n\\nSo we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs  Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty  but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine  oh boy... First off  my poutine had very little of everything  very little duck  very little cheese  and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So  it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good  a good fry you can taste the potato still  not these. They didn't even seem homemade. \\n\\nMr. Ramsay  if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants  I'd suggest coming here  to Qu\\u00e9bec City  and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places  easily  that serve better poutine  and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind  to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact  I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city  to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine  bison burgers  and more  oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck  tons of very fresh cheese curds  an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course  for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat  still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I sincerely doubt you can get your money's worth for anything there.",

        "text": "Well - I only write reviews in 2 instances:  1. the food and/or experience was totally awesome and would warrant a revisit.  or 2. the complete opposite - the food and/or experience was dismal and disappointing.  Sadly GR Pub and Grill was the latter. \\n\\nI am a huge GR fan and was very excited in trying Mr. Ramsay's inspired menu and experience his detail to service. We arrived around 1:15pm for lunch and waited for a few mins while waitstaff cleared a table.  The restaurant was only about 1/4-1/2 full (at best) and yet we still had to wait about 10mins before a waiter poured our water and asked for drink orders.  I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it was waaaay too heavy on the rum and was not served with lime.  To the server's credit - he was very apologetic - rushed to get me a second one.  #2 Dark and stormy was slightly better (less rum)  but still a sub-standard drink which did NOT warrant the $11 price tag.  Again not served with lime - I had to ask for them.  Not.a.great start.  \\n\\nSo I thought 'ok -we are not here for drinks the food should really speak for itself'. We ordered the deviled eggs per the waiter's suggestion plus I LOVE deviled eggs. I was so psyched to see them on the menu.  I have been known to eat 8-10 in one seating but I digress. With all Mr. Ramsay's emphasis on simplicity - it was lost on this dish.  I thought it was interesting mix of flavors on paper but in reality there was too much going on between the vinegar  bacon and cheese.  Weird texture too with the bits of bacon. The worst was that the egg whites were too firm - like they had been sitting in the fridge for too long or were just pulled out and were not given enough time to soften a little. And the yolks simply did not taste fresh.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by farm fresh eggs.  Nevertheless I was disappointed.  \\n\\nAh but the entree should be better - right?  Nope.  My lamb burger arrived cold.  Cold fries and cold burger. WTF?! Not only did we wait approximately 15-20mins for the entrees to arrive but the my entire meal was cold.  COLD!  Again the waiter was very apologetic and rushed a second burger out to me.  So this one was warmer but sadly it had absolutely No.taste. None. Could not tell it was lamb.  In Mr. Ramsay's words: BLAND!.  It was not seasoned.  I've had better tasting lamb in the local middle eastern restaurant here in Pittsburgh.  I cannot speak to my mother's dish because it contained gluten but she said her heirloom tomato sandwich was quite good.  So there was one bright spot.  Then again she admits that she really does not care about food e.g. tastes  flavors  experience as much as I do.  \\n\\nIn conclusion  I had very high expectations for Mr. Ramsay's food and restaurant.  For the prices he charges I should have been WOWed.  Instead I left disappointed and very unhappy.  I do have to mention that the watier was thoughtful enough to offer a 20% employee discount which brought our lunch total to $59.02 but still a pricey sum for a sub-standard-will-not-return-to-lunch.  I would not recommend this place.  Sigh.  \\n\\nHappy Dining \\nKK Teh",

        "text": "\"Sadly  I have to give Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill at Caesars Palace  Las Vegas  a less than stellar review. I can only muster the kindness to give this restaurant two stars.  I must admit  that were my rating based solely on my latest dining experience there  I would give the restaurant three stars  and  had I based my review solely on my first dining experience there  I would have given four stars.  I'm sure that you will ask  \\\"\"\"\"How does the average of 3 and 4 equal two?\\\"\"\"\"  The answer: disappointment.\\n\\nThis will sound silly  but bear with me.  The reason I returned to P&G after my first visit is also the reason I will not return: potatoes.  Specifically  two potato dishes: the Potato Puree and the Pub Fries.  These were not ordinary mashed potatoes and French fries.  These were a demonstration of what a potato can taste  like if a fine-dining approach is taken when preparing ordinary dishes.  Every now and again you taste a dish and experience it for the first time all over again.  Such was my experience with the fries and mashed potatoes at P&G.  They made me feel that  as a foodstuff  potatoes have much more potential that I had previously imagined.  \\n\\nThe key to their french fries was the cooking technique: thick-cut potato planks  steamed  then lightly coated in seasoned flour  then deep-fried  then baked.  The result:  a hearty potato plank with a crispy outer crust that created the perfect seal to keep steam inside.  When you cut into them  you discovered a steamy  flaky potato meat.  These fries did not need any condiments whatsoever  and highlighted how good a potato can taste if treated properly \\n\\nThe mashed potatoes had a beautiful flavor.  The fluffy peaks of this dish were topped off with a drizzle of a chive infused olive oil that exploded in your mouth  filling your entire palette with the aroma of garden-fresh chives.  The key to this explosion was temperature of the potatoes: served piping hot.\\n\\nOn my second visit  I ordered these two side dishes again.  This time  the Pub Fries were plain  old french fries  and slightly soggy at that.  The mashed potatoes were a salty  gluey concoction that someone had tried to repair by thinning it out with copious amounts of cream and butter.  They were served cold.  \\n\\nOther highlights of the evening: arrived at 7:15pm and checked in for my 7:15pm reservation.  The hostess forgot to check me in  and when I made eye-contact with her every time she seated a walk-in customer before me  she quickly looked away and left the podium.  I approached a different hostess and was seated right away.  I ordered the seared scallops: scallops were seared on one side only. They were served in a bland seafood broth  with carrots  and artichoke hearts.  Not flavorful at all.  I ordered an espresso with dessert and it arrived cold.  The chocolate mousse trifle was sensational  though.\\n\\nAt any rate  I believe that what happened to this restaurant is not  so much carelessness on the part of its founder or staff.  It is a reaction to the caliber of the customer.  I spoke to the manager about the food  and he admitted that they had to change some recipes because their customers did not see the value in waiting extra time for french fries to be cooked three ways or for mashed potatoes to be prepared to order.  So  they have turned from their fine-dining philosophy to a food-mill philosophy: crank out orders.\\n\\nAnd that is where the disappointment lies.  P&G once provided a fine-dining take on British pub fare.  It now caters to the lowest common denominator and provides tourists a place to grab a quick bite and gain some bragging rights: \\\"\"\"\"I went to Vegas and ate at Gordon Ramsay's.  You know?  That guy from TV?\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nSadly  the Gordon Ramsay on TV is no longer anywhere to be found at P&G.  The Gordon Ramsay on TV preaches fine ingredients   food prepared to perfection  good seasoning  good service  consistency  and  above all  passion and pride.  Where is the pride to be found when you don't stand by your food  and  instead  you cut corners to ramp up production.\\n\\nSorry  that's not fine-dining.  That's a factory.  I'll gladly drop $20 at Applebee's for factory food.  Not $200 at Gordon Ramsay's.\"",

        "text": "\"Kitchen Nightmare\\nI took a few days off last week to celebrate yet another year getting away from me. My wife and I went to Vegas  not for the gambling but for the entertainment and food. We stayed at Caesars Palace and one evening we thought we'd try the \\\"\"\"\"Gastro Pub\\\"\"\"\" experience offered by none other than Brit Bad Boy  Gordon Ramsay. Truth be told  although I love to cook  I'm not a huge fan of cooking shows  and shows where Mr. Ramsay makes a buck by humiliating what are often hardworking (albeit out of their depth) restaurateurs I find less than edifying. As a fellow reasonably foul-mouthed Brit bad boy who has been known to yell on occasion  maybe I just find it too close for comfort.\\n\\nIn any event  I love good Pub Grub so we gave it a shot. In their defense  the beer menu was excellent and the chips (French Fries for our US cousins) were authentically soggy and British... but beyond that  the food was just horrible... by far the worst we had all week. What was especially galling was the pretense that this was in some way Great British cuisine. Let's all agree on something... much (if not most) British food is horrible... really horrible. It's food made by poor people from less than great ingredients  typically over cooked under spiced and dull. It may have won us the British Empire... but it would get one star on Yelp on a good day. It is possible to do British staple dishes really well  with great ingredients and proper care Bangers and Mash or Fish and Chips can be killer... that's what's behind the current craze of \\\"\"\"\"Gastro Pubs.\\\"\"\"\" Unfortunately  done poorly Brit Grub just sucks... as did the Fare at Mr. Ramsay's Caesars Palace joint.\\n\\nTo start with the bread was stale. I had the fish and chips with mushy peas; my darling wife had the \\\"\"\"\"mixed grill\\\"\"\"\". The fish bore absolutely no resemblance to real Fish and Chips  and the mushy peas were simply green peas which had been pulsed in a blender for a couple of seconds... not remotely authentic. The mixed grill (to phrase it how Gordon himself might) was \\\"\"\"\"F*@king atrocious\\\"\"\"\". The steak was perhaps passable (though over-cooked and served cold)  the weird pork belly thing was a revolting gelatinous mess  and the lame lone shrimp was either horribly spiced or perhaps spoiled. The waitperson did her best  and when I pointed out the shortcoming she apologized but made no effort to resolve.\\n\\nMr. Ramsay  if you are going to use your brand and our heritage to foist over priced high concept but poorly executed crap to an unsuspecting world  would you at least take the \\\"\"\"\"British\\\"\"\"\" part out of your promotion to save us the national embarrassment.  There are a thousand chip shops or hole-in-the-wall cafes up and down our damp nation which wouldn't dream of serving up the swill you deal out in Vegas. It is (by the way) entirely possible to do that kind of fare well in a Vegas context  Todd English proves that to be true every day of the week. If the menu at Caesars was ever decent  it is being betrayed by your team there... sort it out!\\n\\nIf this makes it to your hallowed halls  we ate on September 10th and our check number was 1884527.\"",

Unfortunately  we were sadly disappointed.  We were there at 6:00 on a Monday night for dinner.  The place was nearly empty.  So whom do they sit next to us  when there are dozens of open seats everywhere?  A table of 4 loud drunks.  The server came up to us immediately  but that was the high point of the evening.\\n\\nWe ordered fish & chips and prime rib  both of which also came to us immediately.  My fish was cold  my fries were cold and greasy  my husband's prime rib was nothing special.  His vegetables were cold and mushy; his mashed potatoes cold and tasteless.  When we questioned the server  he said that the fish & chips were made \\\"\"\"\"only\\\"\"\"\" 5-10 minutes before our order.  If he admits to 5-10 minutes  I bet on at least 30.  I thought that Gordon's restaurants always made dinners to order -- at least something as traditional and simple as fish & chips.  How can you screw that up?\\n\\nBesides that  the place just doesn't feel and look clean.  The silverware is put right on the table  which in our case was covered with sprinkled salt  a sure sign that the table had not been cleaned between diners.  The uniforms of the servers were wrinkled and mismatched.  I'm not sure what look Gordon was seeking  but the servers clearly do not have the same \\\"\"\"\"vision\\\"\"\"\".\\n\\nWhen we complained to the manager  he was dismissive and condescending  making sure to inform us that \\\"\"\"\"Gordon had just been there last week and everything was great\\\"\"\"\".  Well maybe great when the boss is around  but with zero or no quality standards when he is not.\\n\\nBottom Line: Save your money for fish fries at your local Catholic church during Lent.  Gordon's made enough money from hard-working \\\"\"\"\"no counts\\\"\"\"\" like us.\"",

I liked the mushrooms and my gf liked the olives.\\n\\nFor entree we picked the beef short ribs  the elk o'bucco  and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were seasoned well and very yummy. The Elk was very dry. It's definitely missing a component of fat to address the dryness. The short rib was much better texture wise.

Yes  you totally wouldn't expect a joint such as this at a gas station to serve such good food like Chile Verde does  but you are in for a surprise. Plus  you can't really see their signage since it's on the same one as the gas station prices  but I guess they get all their business through word of mouth and of course Yelp. Our church group uses this gas station for our fireworks booth and 2 years ago when we first did it I didn't really pay much attention to them. Now that I read all these awesome reviews I definitely had to try them out. During our 6 days we were there I tried them 2 times and they certainly did not disappoint! The first time I had the nachos with beef and everyone is right the tortilla chips are made fresh and they are delicious. Unlike  Roberto's who has dry nachos and carne asada  their version of beef nachos was certainly not dry but had some moisture to them. I'm glad I asked for my beans on the side because it would of ruined the awesome texture of the fresh tortilla chips. The second time I ordered the California burrito  which was priced at around $5. This burrito was huge! At other places they would probably price it at $6 or $7 which makes Chile Verde affordable. I bet 2 people with smaller appetites could share that burrito because I could only eat 3/4 and let me tell you I am an eater. The inside of the burrito had fries and beef with salsa. Pretty delicious I must say. My only major gripe is that the owner is a 1 man show! He is the cashier  the cook  the expediter  everything! I know he is probably doing that to reduce costs and keep prices low  but man the wait time is rather long just like everyone says. Both times I was there  he was super busy. Although the second time the food came our faster than the first. The first time I think I waited a good 15 minutes. If only I lived in this area  but I guess this joint adds on to the foodie spots on Rainbow Blvd/South West area. The chimichanga looks good and I will order that next time I'm here. Chile Verde is definitely a step up above Roberto's and if you're in the area craving Mexican food  definitely hit Chile Verde up!",

So we come for a later dinner and I hoped the pizza was great. \\n\\nI wanted to try the smoked salmon pizza and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others. They debated if it had sauce or not. It said it had mozzarella  aioli  etc etc that I read off the menu to them and said I just want what was on the menu. They started talking amongst themselves didn't hear me and then put red sauce on the pizza. Red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and I didn't want it and said that didn't seem right  but they insisted it does....even though they didn't know what was the toppings on it just earlier. They still seemed confused about the pizza so I said \\\"\"\"\"Can we just get the calabrese pizza instead?\\\"\"\"\".  They did know that one so I just rolled with it. There are less than 10 specialty pizzas or make your own creation....I would assume being a pizza maker you would know what goes on the pizzas. \\n\\nWe ordered also their chopped salad  as that salad is pretty delish. I definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of everything in each bite. \\n\\nThe pizza comes and it's definitely soggy and watery. You can see the pool of it in the picture. It was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so I debated if I should return it or not. I tried a bit of my piece and decided it was too soggy to deal with. I walked up and showed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home  but it just wasn't okay. The guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.\\n\\nThey refired it and it was better. It was not as good as the BFs last pizza according to him. I suspect it was fired up by that one guy who used to make the pizzas at Parma and our pizza was made by newbies.\\n\\nThere's a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase. I was distracted so I didnt redeem that  but make sure to check in if you come. \\n\\nI don't know how to feel. I WANT to like this place is the trouble. It's Chef Marc  it's VPN style pizza  it's by my house and I really like that salad. It's getting good reviews now  some of my friends like it too. It seems WHO makes your pizza makes a difference....they come when Chef is here. It's hard for me to ever come back after this. It must be really inconsistent quality.\\n\\n It makes me sad to not feel zesty pizza redemption the second time around. I don't get the hype.\"",

Then  when she dropped our food off at the table  she told us that she screwed up and that we needed to go back to the register to make it right. Really? You screwed up  you walked over to tell us about it  but we still have to come back to you to help you fix your mistake? Shit  many places would've just eaten their silly mistake because it was their fault...or at least not required us to get in line again  but these guys expected us to come back and clear things up after they both screwed up and stopped by to tell us about it. That's just bush-league bullshit. Couple that with decent food and unjustified hype and you get a 2 star rating. Simple as that.\"",

So  the week before I'm set to move in  I go online and set up a package deal for internet/phone/tv through Qwest (who uses DirecTv for the TV end of the deal).   Qwest sets up an installation date for the second day after I move in.  I'm thinking  \\\"\"\"\"great  that was really quick.\\\"\"\"\"  One problem:  Qwest only set up the phone and internet.  At no point did they tell me beforehand that I needed to set up a seperate install time with DirecTv.  Since I made a one-stop purchase  I assumed a one-stop installation.   \\n\\nI was wrong. \\n\\nVery wrong.  \\n\\nOn September 30  I called to set an installation time with DirecTv.  Having just purchased an HDTV  I requested an HD tuner (duh).  They said the earliest possible install date would be October 25 for even basic  normal  no HD equipment.  I grudgingly accepted that date.  What else could I do?\\n\\nFast forward to October 24.  I'm excited to finally get TV in my condo.  However  I have yet to receive any kind of call to set up a time for tomorrow's install.  I decide to call DirecTv and see what was up.  Guess what?  Not only was I never put on the schedule for a delivery date and time  but even if I was  they have a backorder on the tuners for an unspecified amount of time.  I asked the supervisor what day I could expect to actually get installed  he said  \\\"\"\"\"I don't know.\\\"\"\"\"  That's a pretty effing bad answer if you ask me.  Furthermore  while they were willing to do a basic install (about a week from now) and then bring the HD tuner when it came into stock  they said I would be charged twice for installation  and when the tuner actually did arrive  I would have to cancel service and then reactivate service with all sorts of fun fees they were unwilling to waive.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is  it will likely be two months between the time I ordered my service and the time it actually gets installed.  \\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"Somebody up there loves you\\\"\"\"\"  but it sure as hell isn't me.\\n\\nUPDATE:  I finally got installed  and guess what?

We waited ~40 minutes from the time we ordered and then the food was not that good either.  I tried the rotisserie chicken salad on a previous visit that was very good   but this time the food was a big disappointment.   \\n\\nWe had high hopes for Letty's  but after today I do not see us going back anytime soon with rock solid restaurants in the area like Landmark & Portofino's.  \\n\\nI hope Letty's will fix their issues and we will consider giving them another chance once the memory of the very bad experience today fades.",

We told him we had an Escalade that we were trading in and that we had just started looking and considering our options.  \\n\\nWe contacted the same sales person this past weekend and asked if he had a 2015 Escalade in inventory which he stated he did and we advised him that we would be coming by this past Saturday to see the car.  When we arrived the Sales Manager immediately took our keys to our Escalade and ran inside to get the General Manager  Tom  to have him look at our car.  \\n\\nWell  needless to say  this totally started out the wrong way from the very beginning.......... Tom  the General Manager  walked right past us and did not even acknowledge us.  His attitude was curt  very rude  negative and condescending.\\n\\nThe Sales Manager and Tom immediately started talking money (mind you we haven't even seen the car they supposedly had on the lot yet) and the pricing was different from what the Sales Manager had originally quoted by about a $2000-$2500 difference.  Not a lot in comparison to buying a $100 000 car  although  it is the principle  and we had not even seen the car.  \\n\\nWhen we asked if we could see the car they had on the lot they stated they must have just sold it and that they could not get another Escalade for about 2-3 months.  Tom went back to his office to see if there was another Escalade available and said that there was one although they would not have it in inventory for about 2-3 weeks.  Then he proceeded to tell us there were no Black Raven/Kona 2015 Escalades in AZ  maybe one in CA and 0 in NV.  We asked if they traded with other dealerships and again he stated there were none in AZ.  \\n\\nWe had purchased our previous Escalade when Earnhardt was Legends which was a good experience.  Going to Earnhardt was such a huge let down  they were so unbelievably rude  unprofessional and honestly they did not know the product they were selling.  Needless to say we were extremely disappointed in the way this whole situation was handled.  This was the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE we have ever experienced and we left abruptly.  \\n\\nBottom line.... . we looked online that same day and low and behold we found 4 Black Raven/Kona 2015 Escalades  in AZ no doubt  and at Arrowhead Cadillac in Glendale.  \\n\\nJust fyi Earnhardt Cadillac...we drove off the lot on Sunday with our brand new 2015 Black Raven / Kona Interior Escalade from Arrowhead Cadillac.   \\n\\nFor those of you considering a Cadillac purchase  do not waste your time at Earnhardt Cadillac  make the drive and go to Arrowhead Cadillac in Glendale.  Arrowhead offered us the most incredible  professional experience we have ever had and they treat you like a person should be treated  with a little respect.   Everyone was happy  the dealership is beautiful and the Sales Managers know what they are doing  this was such a fun and seamless experience.  Arrowhead has earned our business.",

The lunch combinations are delicious and presented beautifully! The menu is more limited during lunch  so I'll definitely be back to try their dinner options.  I tried the kushi-age (translation: fried food on a stick) combination which was a perfect combo of meats/seafood/vegetables.  The skewers are small  but I left very full.  The kushi-age also comes with two seasoning salts (pepper/curry) and a ponzu style dipping sauce.  The combination comes with unlimited rice and cabbage salad...so if you like rice  this is your place!  The soup is a pork broth that has a mixture of vegetables and is quite filling in itself and warm fuzzy goodness especially during the winter.  Currently they are serving a special ozoni new years version with rice cakes inside =).  The BF ordered the kurobuta pork combo....and it was fried to a perfection and moist and flavorful on the inside.  This combo came with a mortar and pestle....so you can grind the sesame at the table to add to the katsu style dipping sauce.  I was skeptical what additional flavor this would add  but they really know what they are doing....the freshly ground sesame was aromatic and mixed beautifully with the sauce.  We also tried the an-mitsu with ice cream which is basically fruit salad with ice cream  agar  and red beans...but nice and light refreshing end to the meal.  This will be our favorite Sunday lunch spot for the near future =)  Beware this is a small place with 6-7 tables and additional sushi bar style seating...so in the evening time I can only imagine the wait time.",

The guy asked me if I had facebook and I immediately said mmmmm..NO. (I didn't know who he was) He then said that if I did  he wanted to ask if I could \\\"\"\"\"Like\\\"\"\"\" his donut shop on FB that will be opening. I had two thoughts after this #1-How could I \\\"\"\"\"Like\\\"\"\"\" something that hasn't opened yet and #2-OMG a new donut shop  I'm soooo excited! I told him that I will be there as SOON as they opened!\\n\\nI would first like to say that my LOVE not like but my  LOVE of donuts are SERIOUS.However  in fairness I am a glazed twist type of gal. I HATE donuts that aren't fresh  I hate them so much that I arrive usually at donut shops as early as I possibly can to get the fresh batch! Onto the actual review....\\n\\nThe shop is so CUTE! PINK EVERYWHERE! The customer service was AWESOME. The guy with the pink shirt was so friendly and asked all my questions. I looked at the options of the donuts and was a little frightened..I'm not the adventurous type. After looking at bacon donuts and bleu cheese mixed maple..somethin..somethin..apple..idk I picked a simple GLAZE and JELLY donut. I was so happy because the guy told me that the glaze was FRESH. I couldn't even wait until I got home to eat it! I felt the warmth of the glaze from inside the bag!! How can you drive all the way home with knowing that?NOT I!!! So I grabbed that beautiful warm donut  and took a huge bite. My first thought was CRUNCHY..CRUNCHY? The inside wasn't as \\\"\"\"\"fluffy\\\"\"\"\"  as I would've liked. It was more of a FRIED HARD DUMPLING with glaze. It was more of a CAKE DONUT texture inside rather than a...fluffy..light donut. The inside tasted like it had maybe nutmeg or cinnamon or..both which was a DIFFERENT taste.I just wasn't expecting it. My purpose of getting a SIMPLE donut was to to get a SIMPLE donut. I dont think this is a SIMPLE donut place! I went home and tried the jelly donut. The \\\"\"\"\"jelly\\\"\"\"\" was sour  it seemed homeade but..sour. My bf liked the orignal glaze but didn't like the jelly filled at all. He thought it was pretty sour too. He only liked the original glaze when it was warm  apparently it tasted \\\"\"\"\"DIFFERENT\\\"\"\"\" when it cooled off. That was just his opinion.The icing they put on their donuts aren't enough for ME. I would like a balance of the Krispy Kreme and Winchells icing amount.\\n\\n ughh I feel so bad doing this review because I think the people were soooooo NICE  but it just wasn't what I was a fan of. I think I was looking for a SIMPLE..BORING donut place and got..if Dr Seus owned a donut shop place. If you're looking for something different try them out! This just wasn't a good fit for me sadly.\"",

Mind you  the original waitress we had was nice but then she went on a break.  Another person relieved her but we never saw that person the entire rest of the meal.

The bartenders were great and our server was extremely helpful  knowledgeable and attentive. Love the iPad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions. Draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers.\\n\\nFood: We ordered the Farm burger  Euro burger and the Brittania  and they were every bit as amazing as I was hoping they'd be. The burger patties themselves were out of this world. Cooked perfectly to order. Moist and tender on the inside  and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew. The blend of cuts was awesome  and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar. The natural taste of the beef really shined through  and the fact that they're grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just can't get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use.\\n\\nA burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own  with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein  and that was definitely the case here.\\n\\nThe Farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious. The Brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it. My personal favorite was the Euro burger. The goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top. In each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced.\\n\\nThe jalapeno poppers were really good  as were the onion rings. The chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty. I wish I could've brought a bottle of that stuff home with me.\\n\\nIs it more expensive than most other burgers? Yes. Is it overpriced? No.\\nCould you find bigger  heavier burgers? Yes. Is it any less satisfying? No.\\n\\nSome people have this idea that the more a burger costs  the bigger it should be. Uh  no. The more it costs the BETTER it should be. If all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money  walk down the street to Fatburger  or find some fast food chain. But you get what you pay for  so if you want quality  if you want the absolute best burger in Vegas  and certainly one of the best anywhere  Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is the place to be.\\n\\nI'm just gonna say it... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay  or nothing special  etc. Those people have no idea what they're talking about.\"",

There is always a wait but you can put your name in and they will send you a text when your table is almost ready so that you don't have to just stand in line. The first time I tried the burger the pepper on it and it was HOT I ended up having to pick it off halfway through but the flavor was incredible. The sweet potato fries are a must try  they are served with a dip that really makes the fries better than anyone else's. The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin  they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well. We tried the parmesan fries the second time and they are good also  they come with a garlic dip that is super potent but goes well with the parmesan on top of the fries.

You have like 275 shows on TV  most of which consist of you screaming your balls off at some poor sap because \\\"\"\"\"the soup was dry\\\"\"\"\".  I only ever watch Master Chef  and that's because you dispense earnest  humanizing advice that gives the impression that somewhere deep inside  you still kind of give a sh*t  which your image desperately needs.  But seriously  Master Chef Junior?  What's next?  Master Chef 'n Da Hood?

So  because of this  I went to BurGR (the only one of your Vegas restaurants I can consistently afford) with the firm predisposition to hate it.\\n\\nAnd based on the decor alone  at the beginning I totally did.  Your face is all over the damn place  your hostesses looked plucked out of a Hooters calendar  and the flames-and-metal decor is over-the-top and uninviting.  But  I have to say  once I sat my ass down and started stuffing my face  my mind changed quickly.  Been three times already  and it wasn't some kind of fluke.  The garden burger with the duck bacon and fried egg is as good a burger as I've ever had.  Definitely top three.  The fries with the fancy ketchup are absolutely delicious and the service was quick  effective and infallibly polite.\\n\\nI also have to give you kudos for keeping prices reasonable  at least comparatively speaking for a Vegas strip restaurant.  Fries are not included with the burgers but one order can easily feed two people  which is nice to know in advance.  You have an awesome beer selection and I was pleasantly surprised to see that for $6  I get a tall pilsner glass filled to the top.  The Innis & Gunn is a particularly awesome pairing with any of the burgers.\\n\\nAnyway  I still find you kind of odious  but food-wise  BurGR is firing on all cylinders  and ultimately that's what's important.\\n\\nThe water was a bit raw  though.\"",

We started with the Truffle Fries  which were tough and tasted stale. Instead of being golden brown and crisp  they were pale and appeared to have been sitting a long time between frying.  When offered a replacement  we switched to the Maui Onion Rings and they truly were fabulous.  The worst part of the experience though was the burgers.  We ordered one Farm Burger and one Chanterelle Mushroom Burger  both well done.  Both came  sans any sauce  and severely under done...very pink inside. You would think a restaurant specializing in burgers is very experienced in cooking them to the customers desired done ness (otherwise why ask \\\"\"\"\"how would you like that cooked?\\\"\"\"\").  We sent those back as well  and told the waitress to not rush  we'd rather have them done than fast.  When our replacement burgers arrived  one was fine but the other was pink on one side.  When it was returned as well (with no offer of selecting a different entree)  we were so disappointed.  My teen ate her Farm Burger and just as we were ready to request the check (and go find another option for lunch for me since I was now starving)  the on duty manager approached and comp't our meal.  This was nice (and the right thing to do)  but I would have greatly preferred to speak to him much earlier and actually eat something for lunch  so having him not appear until that point was actually the coffin nail that labeled our experience an \\\"\"\"\"epic fail\\\"\"\"\".\"",

Definitely not! \\n\\nWait - No wait at all very prompt to get our table. \\n\\nPre-Ordering food - Our waitress showed us the drink menu on an iPad (pretty cool) and gave us enough time to make up our mind.\\n\\nOrdering food - I asked specifically if the Damnation Chicken Burger was spicy and if I could have it with a normal beef patty. Our waitress said it had a good kick considering it had \\\"\"\"\"fiery hot mayo\\\"\"\"\". I love a good spicy burger so I ordered that. We also got truffle fries  onion rings  and the farm burger. \\n\\nTo start we got our food in a decent amount of time  slightly longer than expected but nothing to bad. \\nFirst my onion rings never came. I asked when they dropped off the food and it wasn't our waitress who dropped off the food. The women said she'd go ask them to make them but they never came at all. \\nThe truffle fries (which our waitress said were \\\"\"\"\"well worth the few bucks extra  they are so much better) were a huge disappointment. When it says \\\"\"\"\"truffle Parmesan\\\"\"\"\" and \\\"\"\"\"truffle salt\\\"\"\"\" they mean they lightly sprinkle it on the top of the normal fries and charge $3 extra.  Solid tasting fries but we wanted the normal ones and she really pushed us to get truffle fries and they weren't worth it at all. \\nMy burger was the damnation burger. It had no spice at all! I don't know if they forgot the \\\"\"\"\"fiery hot mayo\\\"\"\"\" or what but it was bland. It had no flavor at all. Realistically the bun was the only part that was good. If the burger was spicy like promised and had a little more flavor it would've been nice but honestly you get more taste from Carl's Jr. I would never  ever recommend getting this burger. I asked one of the guys working there if it was supposed to be spicy he said yes  and asked if it was to hot for me. I said no  it had no spice at all and he quickly back tracked his comments saying it's only supposed to be a small but noticeable kick. 1 out of 5 stars burger which is incredibly disappointing. \\nThe farm burger wasn't much better. The burger patty itself was dry and it didn't have much flavor. My friend asked for Ketchup and some of their \\\"\"\"\"cheesy ranch\\\"\"\"\" or whatever it's called just so he could dunk the burger in it to add some flavor. We had to ask three (3) times just to get a side of cheesy ranch as well. About 10 minutes after getting it another waitress we asked came and dropped it off and saw that we had already got someone so she basically dropped it on the plate and stormed off  rude. \\n\\nNow not everything was terrible one waiter or busboy in particular was prompt  helpful and overall did his job well was named Joey. Not sure on spelling but had to ask his name  if anyone from Burgr management actually reads this review he was the only bright spot in an overall terrible experience. We spent about $48 on food and service that was more worth about $15 or less.\\n\\nHonestly Ramsey should start paying attention to his own portfolio of restaurants before filming tv shows about fixing other peoples restaurants.\"",

I think of burger-medium well as \\\"\"\"\"no pink in the middle \\\"\"\"\" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than  say  a beef steak.

Only Gordon Ramsay would design a restaurant with a wall made completely out of glass and fire. Coming here I was prepared to go all out when it came to both the drinks and food. I ordered the chili dog  onion rings  original burger and coffee shake...I know thats A LOT but hey you have to take advantage of the situation especially if Gordon Ramsay is involved. \\n\\nThe onion rings were so crunchy and seasoned to perfection. Just writing this post my mouth begins to water. The shake was crazy too. There was chocolate pudding on the top and coffee shake on the bottom. A serious sugar overload but went great with the whole fancy diner feel of the whole place. The burger and hot dog were also delicious. Both loaded with all sorts of toppings that I would have never expected to be so delectable. \\n\\nIf there is such a thing as an orgasm in your mouth then this place will be sure to give you one.",

I would also recommend the hummus and Maui onion rings for appetizers. The hummus is super fresh and unique tasting and the onion rings are to die for! Don't plan on being seated right away and they do not take reservations. You put your name in and they text you when your table is ready.

Also  the instructors tend to do some of the more complicated things themselves if the students feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nMinuses: It takes for stinkin' ever. I got a color and a trim and it took over 4 hours. Also  the color didn't really come out well either time I've been there (the first color was supposed to come our dark red and came out purple instead -- which I decided to go with because purple is awesome even though it was unintentional). I also got an undercut  which was done pretty badly  mainly because they don't allow the students to have clippers with guards on them. \\n\\nSo  if you're getting something relatively uncomplicated with no color or easy color  this place will work for you  especially given the price. Anything other than that  I would suggest that you look to a professional salon -- which some people might say is common sense  but needed to be experienced first-hand for me.

It's hard to find (especially at night) because they don't have an illuminated store front sign just yet. So keep your eyes open! \\n\\nThe decor is modern. Clean and simple. There are smaller booths around the restaurant that seat 2-4. Large tables are available for bigger parties. There are an ample amount of high top bar tables that seat about 3 per table. Where the high top tables and booths are  you can see the open kitchen. It's a lot of fun to watch especially when they start pumping out their food. \\n\\nTheir food is tapas style  so don't expect large dishes that fill you up with leftovers to doggy bag. Everything on their menu screams fusion. Can't really put a finger on what they're a fusion of so I'll say that they fuse flavors from all around the world! The menu itself is super adorable. They separate their items by categories: pork  beef  chicken  seafood  veggies  cheese and dessert. Within each category  they have around 7 or 8 dishes to choose from. \\n\\nEach plate is priced anywhere from $5 to about $12. I took my cousin and we were content after 4 dishes. And then we saw servers carrying plates of food to other tables and decided to order 2 more dishes. In part  this was a big mistake. We had no room for dessert and became overly stuffed. \\n\\n- Complimentary popcorn: What a cool way to substitute your average bread and butter basket! Perfect amount of butter. \\n- Sticky Bun Tacos: Fried pork belly  pickled cabbage and ginger soy. The pork belly wasn't greasy. I personally think this dish would be better if the pork was shredded. Total of 3 small tacos. \\n- Albondigas: Meatballs with salsa roja with sliced jalapenos. Even without the jalapenos  there's a kick of heat in the sauce.\\n- Brulee Salmon Skewers. Three pieces of salmon on a stick with a honey miso glaze and a side of warm Japanese cabbage salad. I thought the honey miso glaze tasted a lot like regular teriyaki sauce.\\n-Pretzel Brats: 2 mini sandwiches - chicken sausage with cheese gravy and sauerkraut on pretzel bread. This was my fave  hands down. \\n- Cremini caps: Mushroom caps filled with asiago cream and caramelized onions. For all you mushroom lovers  this is a very yummy appetizer. I can sit and muNch on these babies all day.\\n - Tater Tots with truffle oil and parmesan cheese: the tots are super crispy on the outside with a soft and tender potatoey goodness on the inside. Truffle oil taste on every bite. I can munch on these all day  too. \\n\\nShout out to Groupon for making this trip possible!

I'm not the kind of guy who is up for making a big deal out of things.  I was fully prepared to try and ignore it and have some dinner.  The lady?  Not so much.\\n\\n\\\"\"\"\"Ummmm.... excuse me.  Do you smell that?\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nOur host/server sheepishly replied  \\\"\"\"\"Haha... yeah  I guess I'm just kind of used to it.  It comes and goes around here.  It's the whole area.\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nNow  I'm not a huge fan of the East Side in general  but come on.  The parking lot smelled fresh as a daisy by comparison.  There is clearly something horribly wrong with this building  and I hope that the young owners of Nosh and Swig have an attorney to help them get out of whatever ugly lease they are tied up in.  \\n\\nAfter he said he'd be back to take our drink orders  we held our breath  and made a beeline for the front door.\\n\\nI feel awful for them - and I hope they can get into another location.  One that doesn't smell like the parking garage of the Four Queens.  Two tables at prime time on a Friday night?  How many more Fridays can they possibly have in that space?\"",

There's another reason for my madness and Nosh & Swig is a perfect example of a place needing some slack. A food snob could roll into here and completely trash the place. And I admit  the edges are rough  the execution is not perfect. But this place has potential and it has SOUL. What I mean by soul is  the owner was there on a slow Weds night (it was just me  this guy  and another couple) and he was chatting it up at the bar.  I just assumed he was the bartender but then he started recommending stuff on the menu and talking about the recipes. Wow. It was obvious this guy loves what he does and has a passion for his business. \\n\\nThe DRINK: They have a good drink menu  and it seems they have a full \\\"\"\"\"bar\\\"\"\"\". I guess the better way to describe it is they served hard liquor. I got their non-alcoholic blueberry mint lemonade and it was delicious. It was huge (I couldn't finish the whole thing)  served in a mason jar with a side of crack popcorn. Seriously  the stuff was so addictive  I believe he does sprinkle crack on it. \\n\\nThe FOOD: I was starving  so I didn't read up on Yelp reviews when I came here. I thought it was just another Nevada style pub. Noep. It definitely has a bar-feel  especially with the owner chatting it up with the locals  but I'd say it's more a casual restaurant that serves tapas. I got their elotes with garlic butter and cilantro. AMAZING! I eaten my share of elotes but these are different. The sauce they smother it in is pure tantric sex. Yeah.. that's right. \\n\\nNext I got a side of nachos o'brien (peppered pork.house potato chips  dublin cheddar. stewed tomatoes ) and a side of Korean BBQ wings (kimchi spiced chicken  Shoyu reduction). The nachos were ok  but the chicken wings were good  nice contrast of sweet and spicy. \\n\\nThings I didn't like were the chairs  they were too low for the \\\"\"\"\"bar\\\"\"\"\". The prices are a tad high for what you get  but they do have happy hour Tues-Sat from 3-6. I have no idea what that entails  call to see what they offer. And the food got a little messy. It's beautifully presented but difficult to eat. \\n\\n+stars for the great  friendly service  the innovative menu and just an overall vibe of awesomeness. I want to come back and try their Dr. Pepper ribs. That sounds amazing.\"",

Usually I never review a restaurant after the \\\"\"\"\"first look\\\"\"\"\"  my standard is 3 visits  but I felt since my two guests have both been here and were very positive I would give it a go. \\n\\nWe chose to go on a Friday at noon  hoping for fewer customers and perhaps better service. Our decision was correct as far as fewer customers  only 4 other tables  hopes were high and quickly dashed. Our less than enthusiastic server Mariela acted as if we were bothering her by our mere presence. When my dining companions ordered ice water only  you could see  the annoyance in the server's face  however when I ordered an over priced coffee drink she seemed to perk up.  Thus began our dining experience.\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered Eggs Benedict-Florentine with home fries  The Tammy breakfast sandwich with sweet potato tots and the Ham Steak with red eye gravy  two over hard hard hard eggs and hash browns  I duly emphasized \\\"\"\"\"hard on the over hard.\\n\\nThe wait for the food was adequate. \\nThe food arrived; the presentation on the Florentine and the Tammy was nicely done and my friend was very happy with the flavor of the hollandaise  many times hollandaise is not lemony enough  however I noticed the sauce did not stick to the eggs and dripped to the bottom of the plate leaving the english muffin bathed in a sea of sauce...ewww  obviously not properly prepared  probably did not cook eggs and reduction long enough before adding butter. The home fries did not look very appetizing and my friend did not touch them.\\n\\nNo comments on the Tammy sandwich  positive or negative  the sweet potato tots were fine.\\n\\nNow we come to the disaster. If you are familiar with Ham steak and red eye gravy  you know that it is generally a 3/4 inch slice of pan seared ham (preferably seared in a cast iron pan) with a sauce which consists of hot coffee added to the pan juices and emulsified with  cold butter. What I received was an 1/8\\\"\"\"\" slice of processed deli ham  which had been quickly thrown onto a flat top  barely any caramelization on the ham and no sauce on top. I received the sauce a few minutes later in a plastic portion cup. This was not a properly made red eye gravy  I am going to assume it was a bottled imitation. The hash browns were undercooked and cold in the middle and the worst part of the meal  yes it gets worse  the eggs were still gooey in the middle  not over hard. When I spoke to our utterly unenthusiastic server Mariela  her only response was \\\"\"\"\"Um.. oh...well  do you want more eggs?\\\"\"\"\" I replied no because I had lost my taste for them at that point. \\n\\nSo to summarize  the meal was disappointing and when the eggs were sent back the server should have at least offered to take a couple of bucks off the check as a good measure. The service was lack luster and the server was more interested in flirting with the manager than attending to her tables. I left starving and frustrated.\\n\\nI recommend if you choose to try this restaurant do so with low expectations.\\nI will try two more visits and see if they can redeem themselves. I am a three strikes out kind of person  so until my next review.  Chow Chow\"",

For dinner  I had the Seared Ahi salad (delicious) and the Wagyu Rib Cap (most flavorful steak I've had in months) - however  it was only 6 oz....which is kinda small. \\n\\nCome here hungry  cuz almost everything sounds delicious  and their dessert menu is something you don't want to skip! (we tried the trio sampler  and all three were awesome).",

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt given its only been 19 days since opening...the staff was running around  giving food to tables that didn't order the food...our food was either waaaay too salty or under seasoned...it was comical almost.

Nothing was looking too promising since most the places I saw were repeats from Town Square (yawn).  Out of nowhere I see a sign for a place called Poppy Den.  What's a Poppy Den and who is Angelo Sosa? I don't know the answers to either of those questions but remembered seeing a bunch of people on Yelp  who are far more into food than I  raving about the place.  And here it was  standing before me.\\n\\nI was greeted by two pleasant young ladies at the front desk and was quickly seated out on the patio. What's this?!?  A patio dining space in Vegas that doesn't look out onto a parking lot!  I'm sold already.\\n\\nTruthful statement in 1...2...3...The menu was a bit  well  unfamiliar to me ingredient-wise.  Some of the items I've never had before and the ingredients were foreign to me.  But that's what this is all about; trying something new.  I ordered a glass of cabernet while checking out the menu further. It was their house cab and tasted quite nice however I'd prefer a cab to be served in the proper wine glass  not a one size fits all wine glass.  I chose the Kim Chi fried rice for an appetizer/side dish.  Now I don't know who this Kim lady is but I'm in love with her fried rice. The presentation was cool since it had a whole sunny-side-up egg laid on top...different is good; I like that.  That stuff was amazing; I'll return just because of the fried rice.  For my entree I chose the steak and potatoes  with the steak medium plus. To my surprise the steak was cooked to the proper temperature (something a lot of places have a hard time doing) and was seasoned quite good. The potatoes  while odd in shape  were very good as well.  For desert  well  not really a fan of the strawberry shortcake.  The ice cream portion was great but the cracked pepper whipped cream was a shock to the taste buds; not for me.  The cake portion was kind of odd...not spongey  not flakey  not dense  not moist; something was just off about it and I can't put my finger on it.  The consistency was not to my liking.\\n\\nI really dig the atmosphere of the restaurant inside and out.  And let's be real here for a minute  the couple short comings in the meal were made up by the outstanding service provided by Eddie; who evidently is from Texas but not a country boy. Whatever man...I enjoyed dining here because of you and will be requesting you next time around.\\n\\nThanks for providing a unique experience in the oftentimes tiring dining experience that occurs in Las Vegas.  I'm taking off one star solely based on a few menu selections not agreeing with my admittedly inexperienced pallet and the fact that I truly feel that wine should be presented in the proper glassware.

We rather drive to the other side of town and go their location on Lake Mead.

They could very well improve.\\n\\nI'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months  so when I saw it open I had to take a look.\\n\\nMy first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar  but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar  saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers  and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws  napkins  and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place  not big enough for a huge crowd  but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.\\n\\nI sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu  both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good  mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita  on the other hand  was pretty awful. It had the right color  but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there  which is never a good sign.\\n\\nI ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up  I don't know. In any case  it was edible but not at all remarkable. \\n\\nWhen the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish  overcharging me  but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.\\n\\nMill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places  all with their own charms  and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year. That said  I'd welcome improvements that prove me wrong. The ball is in your court  Loco Patron.",

The ended up having exactly what we were looking for. The price was very good and so we bought it and set delivery. Afterwards I read the reviews of this place  and normally I would have avoided it if I had read the reviews before I went in. However  after working with them myself I have very little complaints. Let me say  if you are expecting five star service then this is not your place. You get what you pay for. If you want to get five star service you have to pay for it. This is a low price furniture store. The people in store are very friendly and most of the people I dealt with were super nice and helpful. Especially the delivery people. I think the biggest issue is that previous reviewers are not asking the right questions before they buy. So below are a few pointers on that. Before that I will say I got what I ordered  in good condition  and delivered when they said it would be. So I give them 3.5 stars rounding up to four for the friendly service.\\n\\nPointers\\n\\nFirst you must understand  unlike RC Willey and your larger companies  stores like this do not really have a warehouse of furniture. They have to rely on the manufacturer to have it in their warehouse in California and get it to them in time for delivery.\\n\\nWith the above said  you should ALWAYS ask if the product is in stock in the manufacturer's warehouse (they can check this fairly easily. If it is then you will definitely receive it very quickly. If not  be prepared to wait a while  because they cannot get it until the manufacturer provides it.\\n\\nIf you do the above you will have a much better experience with stores such as this one. I honestly would not recommend purchasing unless they do not have it in stock though. It could cause a long wait and much stress on your part.",

        "text": "\"While it's not a \\\"\"\"\"speakeasy\\\"\"\"\" with a secret entrance and a convoluted process for gaining entry  Palms' Scarlet Bar does a fair approximation of capturing that hidden gem vibe.  Scarlet is an intimate 6-seat bar dedicated to craft cocktails and unique infusions set just off the casino floor and tucked away in the corner next to the Ivory Tower elevators.  Decked out all in red (or scarlet  if you will) and lit with red accented lighting and candles  the bar evokes a sexy  if not a bit gothic  feel.  However  Scarlet's draw for the fianc\\u00e9e and me was what it did with its spirits and not its d\\u00e9cor.  \\n\\nI started off with the Rock & Rye ($16) made with Bulleit Rye infused with rock candy  roasted pecans and oranges and served over an ice sphere.  Boozy with subtle notes from the infused ingredients; it was delicious!  For my next go-around  I had the Scarlet G&T ($16) made with Bombay Sapphire East infused with star anise  cardamom  and citrus peels  and Fever Tree tonic.  The infused spices really fit like a glove with the botanicals already found in the gin giving it aromatics reminiscent of Southeast Asian cuisine.  I could imagine drinking it with a nice hot  steamy bowl of pho.  \\n\\nHands down  Scarlet Bar does high quality craft cocktails exceedingly well.  While it's pricier than many of its craft cocktail peers in Las Vegas  I attribute much of that to the cost in money  time  and effort to execute its infusions.  I'll spend a little bit more for a well-made drink.  Scarlet Bar made a well-made drink.  4.25 stars.\"",

Maybe we were just spoiled with Sushi Land back when we lived in Oregon  but this place is so below par we cannot imagine how it has so many good reviews. All the rolls there are tiny  I mean microscopic. It might actually be a better value to go to a normal sushi place than eat here. Since the rolls were so small and thin they had virtually no taste to them at all. I have never had to rely on soy sauce and ginger to flavor sushi so much in all my life. Each roll had so little fish  it might as well not have even had any at all. \\n\\nNow before you go thinking \\\"\"\"\"Well what do you expect at $1 - $2 a plate?\\\"\"\"\" Better  much better  in fact we have experienced sushi a thousand times better at Sushi Land  another conveyor style sushi restaurant for the same prices  but with more sushi and of much better flavor and quality. \\n\\nAlso upon inspecting the menu  several rolls had the same ingredients  just in different order  which the same name rolls in other places we have been to had a good variety in the ingredients to them.\\n\\nThey were so busy when we got there that the poor waitresses were running around like chickens without heads  they had almost no time to be attentive. \\nThey are understaffed for sure.\\n\\nLastly the women's restroom was quite dirty when we were there  and they weren't even open for more than two hours at that point. \\n\\nBottom line  very bland rolls at a price that actually makes them a rip-off. Too little fish and sub-par service (They were nice  though visibly stressed) and lack of cleanliness.\\n\\nOur search for a good conveyor sushi place continues.
