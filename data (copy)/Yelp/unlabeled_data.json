If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is  you can just stop by  and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then  when he diagnoses your car  he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot  and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance  once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in  then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it  and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks  so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.",

Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August  the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid  but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first  Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage  according to our monthly statement  we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment  so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover  there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest  and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \\\"\"\"\"deal\\\"\"\"\" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say  I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.\"",

The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING  and the crust is PERFECT.

Walk up to the counter  order your food  wait for your number to be called  walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.

As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked  not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.

I felt as if I was at a true NYC fabric supplier! Other fabric stores in Phoenix simply do not compare and carry FAR less unique fabrics. Joanne is also more catered to the grandma crowd rather than the modern D.I.Y. creative soul. I highly recommened Sas for all fabric related projects. I've become loyal to Sas for its quality and superior selection. The staff is also very quick and experienced so they get you on your way to fulfill your creative urges! Five stars :)",

When we inquired about sending it to a FedEx location instead of the home address to ensure someone could pick it up  she was absolutely no help in finding a FedEx location anywhere close.  She just wanted to say here computer would not let her search locations.  Really  you can't search FedEx locations from a FedEx????  We asked about Saturday delivery and she had no idea how that worked or what would happen to the package if it couldn't be delivered on Friday.  She wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package.  It was almost like she couldn't hear because she paid no attention to the questions we were asking.  We finally get a price and it is outrageous and she quotes a time different than what we filled out on the slip.  I came home and found a FedEx location very close to where we were trying to ship the package in about 60 seconds on the FedEx site.  We were quoted $160+ for overnight.  Per the FedEx site we got a quote for $110 using generous measurements.  We also got a quote for $77 for Saturday delivery which the store person couldn't even come close to figuring out.  Ultimately we took the package to UPS and shipped for Saturday delivery at $75  less than half of the only option the clerk could come up with.  I have shipped thousands of items with FedEx  UPS  USPS etc. and you do have to ask questions or you can be disappointed.  This gal clearly has not been trained and I don't have enough time to do their job for them.  We were there 30 minutes and finally left because we couldn't get anywhere.  Ultimately we also saved $85 or more than half so the extra hour to get it all done was worth it.  That will be the last time I use this FedEx.",

They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all.\\n\\nNext day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. \\\"\"\"\"Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look.\\\"\"\"\" Fine.\\n\\nCome Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. \\\"\"\"\"So it leaked since Monday?\\\"\"\"\" I asked. \\\"\"\"\"Monday?\\\"\"\"\" \\\"\"\"\"Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge.\\\"\"\"\" He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.\\n\\nSo here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.\\n\\nIf you are feeling charitable  at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me  I have a district manager to write.\"",

What I do expect  and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\\n\\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30  and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55  and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday  this location is open until 12:00AM  and on the weekends  they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\\n\\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off  they would be aware because the signs are off  the exterior lights are off  and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\\n\\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight  but because of the unreliability of this location  I spent my money elsewhere.  \\n\\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said  the sign-lights were off  the drive thru lights were off  the interior lights were off... on the whole  the place screamed  \\\"\"\"\"Don't spend your money here!\\\"\"\"\")  then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\\n\\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell  but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location  I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \\\"\"\"\"This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\\\"",

But that it was whatever now and hung up. I'm not wasting my time dealing with you and your crap when I have more important things to do. \\n\\nI call again and this guy tells me that to pay the bill over the phone there is a service fee. First thing I did was hang up. \\n\\nSeriously? A service fee to pay my freaking bill. That I've been trying to take care of for the last hour? Okay that makes no sense. \\n\\nSo now that I have discovered how truly horribly they are able to take care of their customers I'm really really planning on getting rid of any and all service I will ever have there. \\n\\nWhat is the point in trying to do what you need to when all they do I say is you have to pay this much more for us to do what you need to be done. Or that the only way we can help you is by making you jump through 200 different hoops. Nope. Screw all of you. I'm done.",

The sales guy said he could order them and it would take about a week. So I gave him my contact information and he said he would call me when the slings arrived. Two weeks go by and no call from El Mar Dive Shop. I decided to head over to the shop and check on my order. The same guy who said he would order the slings tells me he forgot to place the order. He asked if I still wanted him to place the order  reluctantly I said ok. Again  he takes down my contact information and tells me he will give me a call when the slings arrive in about a week. Three weeks go by and again no call from El Mar. So again I decide to head over to the shop to check on my order. This time the same guy  I didn't get his name  says the slings arrived. I asked him why I didn't get a phone call  he acted surprised and said somebody should have called. He then lays the slings on the counter  but they are not the size that I ordered. He then tells me that the company they order from  Trident  only makes them in certain sizes and they didn't have my size. So this guy went ahead and ordered the wrong size for me anyway and then tried to sell them to me. I said no thanks and walked out. \\n\\nI always try to do business with local merchants. These days  with the economy the way it is  one would think that a business  especially a dive shop in the desert  would provide better customer service to earn peoples' repeat business. \\n\\nForgetting to place my order  failure to call me twice after saying they would  ordering the wrong size merchandise...three (actually four) strikes...YOU'RE OUT  El Mar!",

RSVP told us to stay in a hotel and they would reimburse us for up to $75.  A few weeks after we submitted our receipts for two days  we received a letter stating that the tenants were responsible for the motor breaking and attached the $700 bill!  And the hotel would not be covered.  When my roommate and I spoke to RSVP  we were told that we were to blame because the filter was not replaced.  We communicated that the filter was replaced last month and he told us we were lying.   He not only backed out on his commitment to fix the repair and reimburse us for the hotel  but blamed us for the old air conditioner going out on a hot AZ summer day.  I am not only completely appalled by the shady company  but appalled by the lack of professionalism in yelling at us calling us liars and that the landlord wants to evict us.    When talking to the owner of the home  she profusely apologized for RSVPs unprofessional behavior and lies.   I will never use RSVP realty for ANY business and will share this story with people.",

We then contacted the department manager named Veronica (the same one mentioned in another review here). Veronica was of no help and in fact her attitude made me realize the store management is the problem. They do not care if customers are helped or walk out happy.

Scott came out to my house in the evening  just to see if there was anything he could do to get an extra day or two  but no luck.  They moved up my installation time  and there was no charge for the extra service visit.  I love my new unit and would never consider using any other company for my a/c needs.",

But honestly I was too afraid to ask them to remake it because by this time they were about 5 minutes till close and I was afraid they'd spit in it or something.  I'll just give it to my husband and the potato will be my dinner.  Then I got back to my hotel  got out the potato (with no fork or utensil) and it was a CHIVE potato.  No chili or cheese.  Just a dry potato with chives.  There wasn't even any sour cream on it or in the bag.  Great.\"",

All over $9. \\nThe whole thing started on Saturday when I purchased 3 dresses for my niece during the one day sale. I bought them at Colonnade. The sale was a one day sale on girls tank dresses for $7. The dresses were clearly marked $7 and there were a mix of solids and print. I bought 3 with prints.  The dresses I picked were all from the side of the display rack that had a $7 sign. They weren't just one or two mixed in there were full size runs. The other side of the rack had tunics for $8.50.  I was charged $10 each. Unfortunately  I didn't notice until this morning when I looked at the receipt. I live by Arrowhead and that's the location I went to for a price adjustment receipt and dresses in hand. I waited in line for 10 minutes before someone helped me. The cashier checked with whom I assumed to be an assistant manager or lead. I was told that the Arrowhead location didn't have this style (same style just a print instead of solid) on sale but they would call the location I went to for verification. I waited for nearly 10 minutes and in front of me the cashier told the same lead that the Colonnade location had put them on sale for $7 because they had such little inventory of the ones that were actually on sale. He then asked if he should just refund me the difference. She told him no and went to check with the store manager. After waiting another 5 minutes she came back and said if I wanted the price difference I would have to take it to the Colonnade store for a refund. I asked to speak with the manager. We waited 10 more minutes for her to come out. From the start she was defensive and rude. She told me that she called that store (because apparently she didn't believe the employee that had already called them in front of me) and told me that I was wrong they never had the dresses set up like that and if there was a mistake  it was that store's mistake and they would be the ones that needed to fix it not her. That's right. She said. Multiple times actually. I told her I am not driving 25 min to get a price refund and she said I can keep the dresses or return them. I asked for a refund and she told me to get back in line and walked off.\\nThis behavior is completely uncalled for by anyone no matter what store it is or what their position is.\\nThe price difference wasn't huge and I probably would have kept them. I was even planning on doing some more shopping. My mom even had several items in her hand and put them back.\\nI won't ever be back.",

Our food came and our waitress came right after and asked us if everything looked ok. That was the last time we saw her until it was time for the check. We came here with a kids eat free coupon and our check was wrong so she had to go fix it. She came back and apologized and told us it was so busy because of the coupon. That's funny because there were several open tables near us. I don't blame the waitress though  is one falls on management and not having enough staff to accommodate more people during busy times or when a coupon is put out. I don't understand why it is so hard to get decent service in restaurants. We are not high maintenance at all  but expect our drink glasses to never go empty  is that too much to ask?

I pretty much go there to buy a few necessities and a 12 pack of soda or what have you and pretty much every time I leave hating that place even more.

There's always a ton of people trying to cross the one lane in front of the store that's barely two cars wide. Then you always have cart collectors pushing carts everywhere and even if they have full time cart gatherers  there's always carts EVERYWHERE! \\n\\n   I think this is the oldest and smallest Wal-Mart in Las Vegas and it pretty much shows. I think the population has since exploded from the time this place opened to now  and this store is not equipped for it. Plus this area is pretty ghetto and there's always a few bums standing in front of the store asking for change and there's always that one family with 5 kids that make going to Wal-Mart a field trip and clog up the already congested aisles.  \\n\\n   The selection here is pretty basic. They don't have a full grocery section so you're pretty much left with all packaged stuff like chips  sodas  breads  canned stuff and cereals. The electronics section is pretty basic also. The got a wall of tvs  a small case of 3 laptops they might be stocking  three or four cases for the games  one aisle of dvds  and they don't seem to have a designated blu-ray section. The only Blu-Rays are usually in a display stand outside of the electronic section. Clothing  men's clothing to be exact  is pretty bad. They pretty much have a few basics like khakis  polo shirts  and some athletic stuff but that's pretty much it. I remember I wanted to buy some wife beaters once and I went to the section and couldn't figure out whether or not they even carried them. I remember it looked like there was some Haynes display and they broke that down and just threw them on a shelf with no prices or anything.  \\n\\n   I usually try to go to the self-checkout when I'm there but those usually take as long as going to a regular line. It usually because people freakin' try to ring up 75 items at the damn self-check  and half the time people don't know how to use the damn machine. \\n\\n   Customer service is non-existent  but it's Wal-Mart and you should expect that by now.

I've never stayed in one of their rooms (because I'm a local)  I can't remember eating at any of their restaurants  I've never skated on their rink  and I've never gone into any of their nightclubs.\\nI'm still scratching my head  regarding reviews written by other locals who live in the NW  yet have stayed in Fiesta rooms (and have checked-in multiple times). Can anyone clear that up for me?\\nIn any event  I've not gambled at the Fiesta Rancho more than I have at any other casino.\\nHowever  I've personally heard or have been in close proximity to 3 disturbing incidents at this casino  whereas I've not seen 1 at all the other casinos combined.\\nWhile playing there  I've heard gun shots coming from the other side of the casino. Many years ago  my car was vandalized in their parking lot. At the time  I didn't pay it a second thought. Last night  a woman's purse was stolen  and the robbers escaped without a security guard in sight. In fact  the woman screamed for a security guard  and one didn't come over for 2 or 3 minutes.\\nMaybe this is just a coincidence  but I really don't believe in coincidences.\\nLike I said...Even though my own property was vandalized years ago  I continued to play there through last night  so this review is not biased from that event.\\nBut  after last night  I'll never play there again. I don't want to worry about potential wrong-doings.\\nI'll gamble with money  but I don't wish to gamble with anything more precious.\\nSorry.",

At 12:05 Liz called and they said that we needed a new alternator and not only that the $20.00 coupon only works for in store purchases (it says car batteries right on it). I told her to pay for the battery and meet me at Gibson....5 minutes later Larry Gibson comes out with the tests from 2 different machines saying nothing is wrong with the alternator. No charge and hope to see you soon......Pep Boys wanted over $460.00.....free installation?

When it did accelerate instead of dying  it was extremely jerky. I did a little research online and figured I might need new spark plugs. Firestone ran their electronic diagnosis ($100) and said yes  it was the spark plugs - and about five other issues (ignition housing  etc  etc). All told  the repairs would cost $700.\\n\\nMy car isn't new (14 years old) and this was the first time it's needed any repairs since I got it last year. So I paid the $700 and picked my car up a day later. The acceleration was noticeably smoother and the car didn't die -- for a grand total of 24 hours. Not a day after its Firestone visit  my car reverted to its jerky  dying ways.\\n\\nI called Firestone immediately and asked for a new appointment  but they were booked for the week. My car kept dying in potentially dangerous situations -- crowded intersections  busy roads  etc. When I finally got back to Firestone  they ran another diagnostic test (for free  thank goodness). This time  they said something was wrong with my transmission and that I should get the car's computer reflashed.\\n\\nWhen I directly asked the repair person  \\\"\"\"\"Why is my car having the exact same problems that it was having before you fixed it?\\\"\"\"\" the man said  \\\"\"\"\"Honestly  I have no idea.\\\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAt least he was honest.\\n\\n(Also of note: I called a different repair shop about getting the computer reflashed  and they were adamant that reflashing wouldn't help when I described my car's problems.)\"",

They're available when you can't get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow quick turnaround on service at a decent price. \\n\\nThe issue I'm having is their immediate upsell on tests and \\\"\"\"\"extra's\\\"\"\"\" and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication. In today's economy  I can't believe that Banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits. People don't have a lot on extra money to throw around--that's why they're coming to Banfield in the first place  right? \\n\\nOur last visit my dog Fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so I asked for a price quote. The first step was to upsell me on tests (allergy tests  skin tests  etc) and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just Rabies and Bordatella. There was a shot for parvo (seriously? thought that was just once when they were puppies) and one other disease I didn't remember. \\n\\nAfter the vet examined Fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him  everything from an anitbiotic  an analgesic  an eye wash  an eye ointment and an allergy pill. Total bill was to be $465. I scrapped the vaccinations (can get them done at the Phx Spay/Neuter Clinic for much cheaper--$40) and all the extra tests--and when I was looking over the needed meds I noticed that the eye ointment was listed at $84.99! For a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment. Essentially we're looking at spending $85 on a tube of neosporin. I was shocked! The tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if I felt it was too expensive. I immediately agreed.  I took the rest of the meds and with the appointment the total came to $105. \\n\\nHere's the kicker--I called 1800PetMeds--the price for the ointment: $35.99 plus shipping--oh it gets better! I called CVS on 7th Street--$24.99 but they'd have to order it. It gets even better than this---So I dropped it off at CVS on 16th and Camelback and went to pick it up in the afternoon--price was $15.99! A whole $70 cheaper than Banfield! Can you believe that markup??? \\n\\nStaff was friendly--everything else was alright--just watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill. Ask the question--are these necessary and does my pet really have to have that? Oh---your regular pharmacy can fill almost all pet medications. Check with them first--you'll keep some of that hard earned money in your pocket!\"",

We also purchased a 3 year in home service contract.  \\nOn the evening of April 29  2014  (just 2 days after the expiration of the service contract) we noticed a thin green line going down the television set.  I called the local number and was told there was nothing they could do  I indicated that having this happen just two days out of warranty and them not honoring it is just wrong.  She transferred me to the service department who also told me there was nothing they could do.\\n\\nI asked to speak to someone above him and he put me through to the service manager  Steve.  Steve again said there was nothing they could do  I asked who I could speak to above him and he said no one.  So I asked for the phone number for the corporate office.\\n\\nI called the corporate office and the phone call was weird  it was as if they didn't want to talk to me  she kept talking over me and wasn't really listening.  She indicated she would call the store manager because the corporate office doesn't make decisions (what?  I've never heard of that).  What is the corporate office for?  \\n\\nI waited one day for the store manager and never heard back.  I then called the store and asked for the manager  they could not find him so transferred me to his voice mail and it went to dead air.  This happened two more times.

This Wal-mart specifically is super ghetto  people take their small children shopping at 11:00 at night  and the employees are extremely unprofessional.  Case in point: my girlfriend stopped at this Wal-mart the other night to get a few things because this location is very close to my house.  Upon entering the store we realized that we would need a cart.  I circled back to where the carts are usually kept to grab one but there were none to be found.  I noticed that Wal_mart had two \\\"\"\"\"greeters\\\"\"\"\" at the door not doing anything.  I asked one of the greeters if they had any carts available  and she responded that all the carts were in the parking lot and if I wanted one I should go out in the parking lot and get one. I said \\\"\"\"\"Seriously? You don't have any carts for your customers?\\\"\"\"\"  She reiterated that I would have to go out to the parking lot and find a cart.   I always assumed that the greeters role (besides putting those little stickers on returns) was to provide customers with a cart.   \\n\\nWal-mart - since when is it the customer's job to collect carts for you?

They said it would be about $250 and Wednesday morning would work if I'd drop it off in the morning when they open.  So I dropped it off at 715am and called around 2pm after I hadn't heard from them expecting my car to be done or close to done.  Turns out they hadn't even looked at my car yet.  Then they told me they had to fix the oil (?) sensor and wanted to do a blue dye diagnostic test.  I paid about 150 for that.\\n\\nAfter about 3k miles I went back and they told me what I had told them in the first place.  Its probably the oil pan gasket and its 250.  They also said it could be something else that cost 850.  I'd invested so much I decided to go for it.  Maybe they're just thorough right?\\n\\nSo a week later I went out of town for a few days and came back and sure enough  oil is still leaking out of my car.  So it must be an $850 repair thing.\\n\\nHowever  I'm a bit annoyed that they try to make you schedule an appointment every time  but they don't have the same respect for your time.  After that first time  the next one I asked them how long it would take (a couple hours) so I scheduled to come in first thing (7am).

I asked the waiter if we  could be given the menu that  outside. He just told us that certain items on the menu we had were 8 dollars. He  never gave us the menu outside. When we were ordering our meal my son asked if you could add shrimp to Alfredo. The waiters that said that he could not do that.  I told him that we were going to pay for the shrimp. The waiter responded that he would have to charge $17 for the extra shrimp. We said thank you but no thank you. When he brought our meal  to the table he asked if we wanted cheese. We said yes and as he was poured cheese on our food he also sprinkled it all over the table.  Food was okay. We will not be returning.\"",

It happens with me all the time  the servers \\\"\"\"\"hands-me\\\"\"\"\" the plates  bowls  curries  breads everytime without fail  insteading of keeping it on the table even when I am in the middle of my meal. \\n\\nAnd the most irritating thing  they always ask you to pay while you are eating. ALWAYS! Why can't they wait for me to finish and then let me ask for the cheque or if it can't be avoided  why can't they be courteous while asking for it. Last time when I went there  the same thing happened and instead of complying  I complained  asked the server that I wanted to speak to the manager. This really spoils *the* experience for me.\\n\\nI keep going back to this place since it is walking distance from my place  but after the last time  never going back!\"",

We had our 7 & 5 year olds with us and we filled out paperwork and waited for a while (about 20 mins or so) before she went in to see the nurse taking vitals. I was sitting in the waiting room with one of our daughters that was a sleep so I was slower getting up to go with my wife. When i knocked on the door to go back there was no answer so I spoke to a admitting person to see if she could let me back with my wife and she said no because I had my daughter. I told her I have had her back there before when we have been there in the past but she still said no. I said ok and sat back down when my wife came out with our other daughter for me to watch and she went back and after a while had passed she didn't come back out like what we have experienced in the past.\\n\\nI knew because my wife was there because of chest pains that she would be admitted and then transfered by ambulance to Phoenix St. Luke's so I was ready for that. My wife then asked the nurse if we could come back to her bed to say goodbye and for us to workout details while she was in the hospital and the head nurse (the one who took the vitals) said that we couldn't be brought back because we had 18 people waiting with us and that was too many! We didn't have 18 people with us  we had myself and 2 little girls. Now there was a lot of people in the waiting area and many were latin (Mexican) and she made it sound very racist against people with families in the ER.\\n\\nMy wife spoke to her (head nurse) and told her we are a family of 4 and that's it and to say what she said was offensive on all levels and if that's the way we were going to be treated then we can go to another hospital!

It's not a museum in the traditional sense...it's more the open-air variety you would find in a third-world country where you would pay to see local peasants making flour with a rock.\\n\\nThe Neon Museum actually consists of two locations - one is the Fremont East area where refurbished neon signs are on display in the street median  the other is a bit north of downtown where there is a \\\"\"\"\"boneyard\\\"\"\"\" of aged neon signs leaning against each other in a couple of lots surrounded by a canvas-covered chain-link fence. Fremont East is intriguing at night as the neon signs form a parade of sorts highlighted by the Hacienda Cowboy hovering over a stoplight (see the gallery). Make sure to watch out for the drunken revelers who frequent the clubs lining the street. They're a mean bunch.\\n\\nI only became aware of the boneyard through Anthony Bourdain's show where he was given a retro-swing tour by a Sammy Davis Jr. impersonator. So after an afternoon in Red Rock Canyon  Jamie W. and I made a beeline to the boneyard only to realize that you have to make an advance reservation to gain entry. Damn. We did take a peek though the fence to see what we were missing - a hodgepodge of gigantic  rusting signs that look almost like a surreal montage of one big hangover. \\n\\nI donated $15 online to the museum  the admission they charge for a private tour  since I did take a few snaps from the outside (see the gallery). I hope they get enough funding to realize their goal of converting the retro-cool La Concha Motel lobby into the museum visitor center. These signs deserve a lot more care than can be afforded in a junkyard. Where's Fred and Lamont? You hear that  Elizabeth? I'm coming to join ya  honey!\"",

We usually spend $200-300 when we come to Vegas  but no longer after our nightmare experience with our recent online order.  We were sent the wrong box and asked to send the box back.  Concern #1 - A customer should NOT have to pay for return postage out of their own pocket for a business' mistake even if they did offer to reimburse for postage.  Eventually we were sent a prepaid label to mail back this box.  \\n\\nThe 3 times I spoke to someone over the course of a week MY order was never mentioned except to say that it went to someone else.  It was not even shipped out after their error was discovered. Concern #2 - My business was NOT appreciated.  I felt my goods were being held hostage until the box that was mistakenly shipped by them was returned by me.  In fact  after I asked to cancel my order I was notified that I would not receive my refund until after they received this mistakenly shipped box.",

We were never given forks or knives and had to ask for napkins that we finally ended up receiving after him telling us he was \\\"\"\"\"a dick for forgetting napkins and straws\\\"\"\"\"  keep in mind there are children around. This didn't stop him from commenting on how his \\\"\"\"\"ass\\\"\"\"\" was in our faces when he was taking the couple next to our's order.\\n\\nMike loved playing the blame game. I ordered a refill of my drink and when he forgot about it he blamed the bartenders and said that he wasn't sure if there was vodka in it. When the table next to our's food arrived 35 minutes later he told them that the rainforest cafe gets their kitchen staff from McDonald's - which is both insulting to his fellow employees and the intelligence of the customers. \\n\\nBefore we started eating we knew we wanted to share the coveted sparkling volcano dessert. Not having mentioned this we were a little surprised when Mike aggressively said \\\"\"\"\"here's a subliminal message\\\"\"\"\" and slammed the sign for the dessert on our table. We ended up ordering it and of course once it arrived it was pretty bad. \\n\\nMike seemed very frazzled the entire time even though his section didn't appear very busy. I strongly suggest that this establishment do some drug testing on their employees.\"",

It was pretty crowded but we only had about a 10 minute wait. So we were seated at our table and the server took a little while to get there. When she got there we ordered our food and we waited for that to come to us (which took quite some time because they were busy). After we got our food  we realized it was made incorrect. I told the waitress bring our dressing on the side  but instead she brought the food WITH the dressing on it and salsa on the side (not to mention there was no chicken on it). Soo flagged a manager and she told us to keep that one and would order another one. Well the next one came out semi-correct. It was still missing the chicken! So hour or less then tentative server decided to say that we didn't order it  which was a lie. So we had to wait  yet again for a third pizza which was different. We started to eat it  but our appetites were shot to hell by the time we realized our stupid waitress was messing everything up. Overall  we don't plan to return to this crumby location ever again. But we haven't ruled out the better location we went to previously in Town Square.  So bottom line  avoid this articulate location. You'd be better off eating Auntie Anne's or Subway instead of this place.",

Now  when we arrived at the hotel we were optimistic because from the outside it looks great. We checked in without any issues and went to our room. This is where the problems started for us. The room was so dusty my boyfriend's asthma was set off within the first 10 minutes. Not only that  but there were hair curlers in the bed  the shower door was broken and the lamp next to the bed has EXPOSED WIRING! We called and req. our room be cleaned and to speak with a manager. The first time I was hung up on  and then they transferred me to the incorrect line  and then I just got the voicemail of someone who never called me back. I wasn't screaming and yelling I was very calm but I was definitely upset. This was a family trip  and all we wanted to do was spend time with our family but instead we had to wait for the maids and the engineer to come and get our room up to par. Also  the lobby smells like a moldy ashtray  and the chicken alfredo at the Tuscany Garden Italian restaurant just tasted like thick warm milk. Three of us had it and we didn't eat it.

I would like to know how to go about submitting a story concerning my experience at Centennial Toyota in Las Vegas.  I brought my 2008 Toyota Sienna in because the door did not open when I pulled on it.  This is a $50K vehicle as it is fully loaded.  I had to make a deposit to have the car looked at.  Three days later I was told my car door was fixed.  Toyota showed me where they charged my warranty $2200 dollars for the door repair.  I tested the door knob and found that the door was the exact same.  Toyota gave me an appointment to have the door rectified  but they tried to charge me the deposit again to have it looked at and threatened to charge me to have the door handle fixed even though they got $2200 from my warranty company to supposedly fix the problem that I brought the care in for.  When I asked what they fixed for the $2200 they got from the warranty company I learned that it was unrelated to what I brought the car in for and I did not authorize random work.  I went in for the door handle and the door handle alone.",

I think a part of us are so used to bottom prices that when we see price  we don't think about the quality (and time and effort it takes to do so) and shy away. I cook and have done comparisons with certain ingredients and the quality is miles apart when there's a slight price difference. I used to call it Whole Paycheck like everyone else and now I  don't.

I had mine frozen (like my heart). Sarie had hers on the rocks (like our marriage). All good.\\nThis place gets crankin around 8 pm. So plan on a busy  eventful  loud experience. Which is exactly what we wanted. There was a birthday girl at the booth next to us. She was very pretty.They did the song and dance for her. \\nAlso  the little mariachi man with the guitar can break down one hell of a 'De Colores' if you're interested in that stuff. I am of course.\\nSkipped out on desserts. who can eat a flan after all that booze and chips and rice and beans? \\nThe BEAR can  that's who! That's why next time I'm rocking CDJ with the big Bear and we'll go all the way with that caramel custard you guys.",

It's cool that there is a bar which serves Belgians and unique beers in Pittsburgh  but they've got a few hurtles they need to overcome. First and foremost - the decor. It was like some weird combination between Cheers  Denny's and an O'Charley's. Sort of campy  sort of 70s  sort of tacky. I'd like them to at least remodel and bring it into the 21st century.\\n\\nSecond  the service. Our server was  little stand off-ish  as though she didn't seem like she actually wanted to be there. Also  for last call on a Wednesday night (which is midnight  I guess) she came by at 11:55  asked if we wanted to order another beer  which we declined because we each had half a glass left. At 12:01  they turned on all the lights  started sweeping up  and pretty much shoo'd us out of there. Granted  it was the night before Thanksgiving  but there were a fair number of people there and they pretty much kicked us out on the curb. Not something I'm used to.\\n\\nLastly  I wish the food matched the beers a little more. They have your typical over-fried bar food  which makes sense if you're drinking a PBR. But when you're throwing down $6 or $8 for a beer  I for one would like something a little less greasy and a little more complex then fries and whatnot.\\n\\nI get the feeling they're stuck between being a campy dive bar  like lots of others in Pittsburgh  and a legit beer-drinkers bar like in other big cities.

I think the only thing that made us giggle a little was whole oral sex with a nanner flick--but hey  we never claimed to be mature. \\n\\nAs you already know  this building is packed floor after floor with mesmerizing works of art  photos  videos and information about the interesting life of Andy Warhol himself.

I'm not sure I've ever taken so much time in a museum to make sure I read every minuet detail. \\n\\nI know it's probably clich\\u00e9  but The Silver Cloud Room blew my friggin' mind. I must have stood in there for like 10 minutes just staring at these floating pillows of silver crash into one another and well--me. What a simple  yet deep and interesting concept. \\n\\nI loved the rooms painted all white with just a few of his paintings hung. You just sit on the bench in the middle and soak in your own interpretation. I sat in the Skull room and just looked up in awe. \\n\\nI really think everyone should experience this museum at least once in their lifetime. The work of this fascinating man truly spoke of the art and times of our generation. it was new  different and left so much room for individual interpretation. I think that's what I love the most. Warhol's work doesn't tell you what to think  it let's you figure it out yourself. \\n\\nOne thing I could do without would be the pretentious preteens running the admissions desk.

Well  either I hit this place on an off night or the food quality has done downhill over the last few years.  I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and the chicken parmigiana.  It came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette that was pretty tasteless.  The chicken parmigiana was just okay.  Nothing standout  and dare I say  Olive Garden has a better chicken parmigiana.  The entree came with a side of ziti that was decent  but nothing special.  I was shocked when the bill came...$34 before tip.  The wine was $8 so the chicken parm cost $26?  Never again.  The food is drastically over-priced for the quality you get.  I won't go back.",

This is a hotel that is way off the strip  Felt like a much older crowd as opposed to Cosmopolitan where it felt like you were surrounded by 20-somethings.. You need a car or take a taxi ($15-$18) to get to most places.  It is 2.4 miles to Bellagio for example  a bit too far to walk after having drinks.  The rooms are dated  no flat screen tvs  water in bathroom has that sulfur smell  new fixtures saved it a bit.  The room I had was huge ( cost $51 a night which included tax and resort fee)like a mini suite.  Too much second hand smoke walking around casino  sportsbook and restaurants  no real bar/night life other than gambling.  Does have a movie theatre and bowling alley as part of the complex.  Food and drinks cheaper than the strip for sure.  Would I stay here again  probably not  the savings on room  is lost on cost of cabs and lack of other nightlife.",

The Palms Casino may as well be a priest  and with each roll of the dice  my man Pete is looking more and more like an alter boy. An alter boy with an ugly hat. As I look at this hat  I noticed a consistent theme. This hat of his will soon be joined by his pockets  as they both prevent the world from seeing what lies beneath -- nothing. What was once there  is now missing  and it isn't pretty. Nor was it smart. With just seven strands of hair  Pete has a face incapable of pulling off the 7-Strand comb-over. So money  combined with the freedom offered in Vegas to dive head-first into a hooker  was Pete's only hope to hump. Don't get me wrong  P never planned on returning to Phoenix with any money  which was fine  because that meant he wasn't bringing back his virginity either. Well  unless you count being molested by this casino. \\n\\nLet me start over. When I began writing this review  I was writing it for the Palms Place resort. I was only using my 6am-and-still-in-the-casino story to explain my exhaustion  and use it as a warning before transitioning into my review of our actual suite. However  as I continued to ramble  I realized that this has enough gems to be a review of its own. So let's jump back in. \\n\\nWith dick and pockets both dry  P refused to walk away from the action. But unlike his hair  my boredom started to grow  and soon left me balls deep in a conversation with some random Israeli gentleman who started our conversation by asking me if I gamble. It must have been the way I said  \\\"\"\"\"Nope  never. Not at all \\\"\"\"\" that convinced him I was interested in spending the next 30-minutes listening to him break down his formula for an 80% winning-percentage in roulette. \\n\\nLike all roulette conversations  this one also was followed up by literally dozens of questions on everything from Foreign Policy to soccer. I was pumped. Luckily  I was saved by irony. About midway through my optimistic response to the problem with America's public education system  I was interrupted by quite possibly the drunkest bitch I have ever seen. Clearly lacking intelligence  and a functioning metabolism  I couldn't deny her originality. Instead of some corny and cliche pickup line  this barefoot bitch thought outside of the box  and just spilled her drink on me. Luckily  it was about 7am  so of course she was double-fisting  enabling my shirt to get shit-faced. Before she could say a word  I stood  shook my man's hand  and announced that I had to go because I think my shirt had too much to drink and it needed to sober up. I think I confused her. Which made sense  because I don't even think she knew that she was carrying two drinks  let alone spilling them. I like to think that she stuck around and finished answering my new Israeli friend's question on education  which eventually led to her sitting on his trapper keeper (if you know what I'm saying)  but who knows. Love is blind. As for me  I walked about twenty yards back to the table  just in time to see my buddy P go broke. It was perfect.\"",

I can't even get the free wifi to work on the first 2 floors like advertised. The hotel itself needs major renovating. It is so dated and the smell is not pleasant. I will say that when checking in  the front desk was helpful. However  we were in a group with 3 different rooms and we asked to be on the same floor which was accommodated. However  upon entering one of the rooms  it was not cleaned yet and so our other guests in our party had to be moved 25 floors up from us. We will not stay here again and would rather stay at the newly updated New York New York or splurge and stay at Aria or Cosmopolitan.",

I got there the day the tradeshow started so I went to their convention center first.  On the way there I just saw rooms after rooms size of football fields all very nicely decorated.  The actual convention center felt like it was like 15-20 football fields together?  I might be slightly wrong but I just know it's huge.  I know I wasn't able to walk every isle and see every single booth in a single day.  \\n\\nNow the front entrance to lobby/casino....look up when you get there.  The ceiling all had paintings on them and looked breathtaking.  I think I stood there for a little bit the first time I walked in.  Also  go upstairs the casino where the shops are.  I really enjoyed that place  they created somewhat a small breeze in there and have it design with buildings that looks like it's from italy.  They have performers there singing at certain time of the day and there's the artificial river with boat and the guy that sings while you're on it.\\n\\nThe room  I was in was a suite and it was one of the nicer suites I been in.  We had two people in the suite but it could've easily fitted few more with the room we got.  I'm not sure how much it cost b/c it was offered to me so I didn't have to pay for it but I'm guessing it would've been pricey.  The service was pretty quick  I pretty much went straight up to the suite without any wait.\\n\\nProbably one of my favorite hotels at vegas so far.\\n\\none more note:  if you seen the michael jackson special done by ABC a few years  you might remember MJ going to one of the crazy stores.  Well Im not sure if it's still there but last time I was there I went in and that store is insane b/c of what they're selling and the price tag.\"",

The tickets were $29 50 each plus a $10.00 convenience from Ticketmaster for this general admission show.  \\n\\nThis was my first HOB show but I do know they have some seating and tables which we were hoping to arrive in time to get one since our old bones just can't withstand the brutality of the pit like we did in the old days.  Anyway  come to find out all of the surrounding tables were reserved only.  $200.00 for the table that included a bottle of Sky Vodka and only (4) metal heads per table.  Really...$200 table at a Anthrax show?  Ok  fine if you think that is worth it.  \\n\\nNow here comes the main reason for my review.  The upper seating deck was available but closed off.  We were told that it would open soon when the floor got packed.  After the first act finished sure enough it opened up but there was a charge.  What???  $10.00 more per person to sit in the upper deck seating.  Come on HOB!  We already paid to be in the venue and hardly anybody went upstairs.  As if you weren't making enough money on the bar you had to stick it to me one more time.  My complaint is if your going to charge extra for seating then do it in the advertisement for the show.  I'll pay for it.  Don't call it general admission then charge extra to sit down in the venue.\\n\\nIn the end I guess I should be grateful I wasn't charged $5.00 for leaning on the wall.",

Ain't no thing - this place is #2 on Yelp. I'm excited! I love food!\\n\\nThe experience:\\nWe were smashed into the wall. There was not enough room to get into our seats. Once the table was moved so all the ladies  in their lovely dresses  could shimmy in  they were trapped - the whole meal - full bladders and all. The service sucked. They already had their guaranteed 20% gratuity (because of our party size). So  we endured a meal full of empty glasses  missing silverware  and a wonky table.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nAverage. We had two vegetarians with us (the restaurant knew about this ahead of time) and when the amuse arrived they were served foie gras mouse. You can't take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter? Two of the courses (in a row) had the same pesto sauce. Not a big deal  but the primary components were so bland all you could taste was pesto. \\\"\"\"\"Sir  for your fist and second courses this evening you will be having pesto.\\\"\"\"\" Come-on!

Luckily we had a long layover; if it was short we would never have made it. \\nSadly  we were there long enough to get served. A pulled pork sandwich  of sorts at least. Since I couldn't pick it up due to the soggy bun  I don't know if it qualifies. The wife ordered a hamburger  which  as the menu stipulates  one can either get medium well or well done. Medium? Nope  can't do it. \\nThere are plenty of tvs about  but you won't be hearing the games. Instead  I hope you like Nickelback; you'll hear lots of it and bland  inoffensive wuss rock of that ilk. \\nAnd one final thing I didn't like was being carded (I'm in my late thirties and look it). The waiter also carded a woman old enough to be my mother (I'd guess 65 yrs old) at the next table. Why? Just following the rules!

I was shocked I got there about 615 PM and there was no line. But the line did show up right after I got in so this was the only plus. \\nI was so set back on how poor the taste of the food was. The crab legs were dried out in side  like that the reheated the legs that went used the night before. The deep fried fish was cold and slimy inside. I took one bite of the lobster and almost lost my cookies  I was worried that I was going to get hit with food poison but it did not hit. \\nThen to top it off I grab some stone crab claws  I grab one cracked it open and it was all moldy inside. I saw that I was totally scared to eat anything  stayed away sushi  the rolls. \\nThe only think that was ok was the claim chowder\\nI will not be back after paying 48.00 for old dried up food. I should have went to the Bellagio Buffet  had split king crab leg and peeled shrimp for 10.00 less. \\nI will not be back\\nService was a 4 star and I wish I could give 0 stars for the food.",

We went to Caesars Bacchanal buffet two nights later and it was absolutely unbelievable. I could spend a whole week just trying all the selections available  and the food quality is top notch. The price was only $2.00/ea more than the Village Seafood Buffet  and there is no comparison. Go to Bacchanal  wait 20 - 30 minutes in line  then enter heaven.

You could smell the tobasco sauce  and he just said that he got it all  but you could see it on the jacket  so I asked for a manager.  The manager came over  and admitted the server had an attitude  and gave me his card  and told me to get the jacket and sweater dry cleaned and to bring him the bill.  He also said he would take care of us  and provide us with another waiter.  Dinner went on.....came time for dessert  and I couldn't decide between two desserts  so the new server suggested the upside apple cake  but said it would take 8 mins  and we asked to have our coffee with the dessert.  After about 15 mins  the server came back with the coffee  and said the dessert chef got behind so it will take a minute more  but he decided to bring our coffee.  Now 15 mins later  so a total of 30 mins now  we have finished our coffee  and here comes the waiter with our apple dessert and the other dessert we asked about but did not order  he said the manager said to bring both.  We waited and finally asked for the check  and the waiter said the manager took off the appetizer (cheese plate  $15) and the cheesecake dessert  the alternate dessert that we did not order  but charged us for the dessert we ordered.  I then went to the manager  and he said that was not right  he told the waiter to take off the appetizer  and the dessert  and I told the manager  but I only ordered one dessert  it wasn't my idea to bring the cheesecake dessert also.  So they ran a credit on my husband's credit card for the first check with the dessert  and took off the dessert  and then ran it again.  First  of all how are you not charging me for a dessert I didn't order  and really for all that trouble  and spilling tobasco on my husband  that is the only compensation  $15 cheese platter  and a $8 dessert?

Lately I've noticed that even though they may have fresh burgers  a 'cool' 'secret' menu (that everyone knows about) they have quite a few problems that have been adding up to my annoyance over the years.\\nI've lived right up the street from this place for 18 years  so I was there when it first opened up (and it was a big deal to the community  no more shall we have to drive down to Lake Mead!) and have seen them develop over the years.\\n1.) Service has gotten worse  the wait time is ridiculous  and to make it more of an insult they have an actual timer for you to watch while you wait. This applies to when it is busy (which I can understand to a POINT- fifteen minutes at the LAST window? Not cool) and when you  come at 11pm at night and wait 10 minutes for your fries and milkshake. I'm sorry  but it has gotten ridiculous over the years  the amount of waiting I have to do inside and outside (inside is worse by the way) so much so that when I went to one in San Francisco (one that had TWO lines by the way) I expected to wait half an hour  but it turned out it took less time to get us through there than it does here at this location when there is only one person in front of you. So it is not an overall In N Out issue  it is THIS place's issue.\\n2.) Prices have gone way up. End of story.\\n3.) It is not unresonable to ask for a grilled cheese to be grilled away from the burgers  on the other grill. Escpecially not when there is an actual option for it. So when I ask  and I find meat chunks on my grilled cheese  I know you did not  in fact  grill it on the other grill. This ties into a very important reason why I no longer come to this location: They rarely listen to what you want  if it is outside of the \\\"\"\"\"Double Double no onions\\\"\"\"\" deal. More cheese? Maybe. No salt on your fries? Perhaps. Half strawberry half chocolate milkshake? Kinda. If they can't hold up to their 'secret' menu  then they should not have it as an option.\\nOther locations are way better.\"",

Chutes and Ladders at 4500 tickets at the desk  dollar store toys located in the ticket reward machine. That's all.\\n-The one air hockey table frequently had issues where pucks would go in and pop right back out  not counting for a score\\n-3 out of 4 of the escalating animal rides that you find in front of grocery stores are broken.\\n-Cruisin' USA started to crash while we were playing it  artifacts appearing on screen and freezing.\\n-So many audio issues - low sound from Time Crisis  no sound from Skeeball  low sound from MvC2  low sound from The Simpsons Beat-Em-Up\\n-We still have over $5 remaining despite playing most of the games (most which cost 2 tokens) and decide to spend the rest of ticket chance games and give the tickets to a child.\\n\\nAnd for the Mini-Golf - it is poorly constructed. The actual courses can be moved by a person's feet and appear to have been made straight out of someone's garage - plywood and fake grass. The barriers of the courses are too low  so balls will constantly be falling off the course and into others' games.  Balls would continue to get stuck underneath the hollow plastic structures.

However  I was dragged here by my family and only agreed to go because I was told of this really cool Coke machine they supposedly had. So after some negotiating  I agreed to go.\\n\\nThanks to the Coke machine  I was easily entertained the whole time I was there. This thing has just about every Coke product made in the USA (Coke  Sprite  Fanta  Dasani  Powerade etc.) and then around 5-7 flavors of each product. It was pretty cool. And I have to admit I tried more combinations than I could count.\\n\\nOh yeah  this review is about the casino. The moment I walked in the door  I felt like I needed a gas mask. I've been in many casinos and bars (and am usually not the one to complain of the person smoking next to me)  but this one reeked of cigarettes. I thanked my family for poisoning me when we left.\\n\\nThe bingo room is huge  and people claim their spot long before bingo starts- these people are serious. And the buffet must be a popular hot spot here if it forms a line of people almost back to the entrance of the casino. Don't worry about getting a babysitter for the kids- they are welcome run around the place  too; apparently they don't card anybody here?\\n\\nObviously  I would have given this casino 1 star  but due to the sweet Coke machine  it gets upgraded to 2.",

Due to my budget restrictions (insuring a family of four  with 2 adults over 50) I basically had two choices  and each was with Health Net. After two months  I can say they have been generally incompetent  and I haven't even filed a claim yet. Their website regularly fails to allow me to make a payment. They don't send me bills by US mail or email  although I've selected both methods. Their Accounting department doesn't acknowledge payments I've made 40 days ago. I do have membership cards  but how can you trust a company that doesn't even have the ability to be competent at the basic stuff like billing and accounting. How could healthcare.gov use a supplier that isn't prepared to take on a large number of clients? After April their customer service hours have been reduced  which is another sign of incompetence. \\nI wish I could go elsewhere  but even if I could afford it  I cannot change medical insurers for 12 months  as I understand it.

It has no legit restaurants and the casinos are ghetto and not strip status. You will also notice that the crowd tends to be different than what you see on the strip. This is more for chill hill billy type folks and the pace is a lot slower here. You will see tourist shops and street performers but nothing you havent seen before.

Saw the reviews for Boulevard and combined with the fact that the location is near my house I was eager to give this salon a shot. I called and asked for an appointment and told them I was a new customer. I was assigned to Amber. Anyways I arrive about ten minutes early for my appointment. I enter and have to stand at the reception desk for several minutes as some workers are cutting hair  one is texting  and the others are chit chatting with each other. Finally someone comes over and offers me a cup of water. While I'm sitting waiting for my hair dresser  my official appointment time starts with no sign of Amber. She ends up walking in a couple minutes late which is absolutely fine by me. Things happen  but what ticked me off was she just acted like nothing happened  didn't even try to apologize for being late. After I sit in my chair the hair cut starts. It seems to go smoothly but once we are finished instead of showing me my whole head(front  sides  back)  without asking if I wanted gel/wax Amber started spiking my whole head. I thought it was strange but I did not say anything. I then paid and left. Later on once I was home and took a shower I saw why she so hastily threw gel on my head. The front was average  7/10. But then I looked at the sides and the back and saw why she put gel everywhere. The sides and back were shockingly uneven. She sneakily covered her mistakes by using gel to hide them. I had high hopes for this place but ended up being severely disappointed. I will not be back.",

It's 0.3 miles or a 5-min walk according to Google Maps.  Perhaps they should have an overhead walkway to the FAshion Mall.  They have shuttles every 15-min to Wynn and 30-min to Caesar's  plus you either have a rental car or cab everywhere in Vegas.  In 100+ temp. who walks?  I'd agree this is a 5-star hotel with the one odd exception that the towels are 4-star.  I mean 5-star towels are fluffy soft and you want to steal them  because they're better than your towels at home.  Everything else from the service and room size is decor is 5-star.  I think you must be complaining about this place  because you have no idea what 5-star means and you just want to sound cool.  I mean seriously.  If you had the same price and choice between TI  Paris  Planet Hollywood  NY NY  Tropicana or this place  which would you take?  If you choose this place  then it's a 5-star  bc all those other places are 4-stars.  You can't call this a 4-star if it beats every 4-star in town.  So the pool's not super-huge  that doesn't make it a 4-star.  Super-huge pools are for casino hotels not hotel hotels.  Perhaps the only problem here is that this place can't compete as well with Cosmo and Aria since they have casinos and they're right on the strip in the middle of the action so they reduce their rates and attract people who have to bitch and whine but couldn't afford Cosmo or Aria even at half their rates.  I also highly appreciate the fact that they have EMPTY refrigerators and two complimentary bottles of water.  There's also a small kitchenette with a stove top and microwave and dishes.

About three weeks ago I brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.  Upon inspection from the guys  the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain  so they suggested to replace those too.  I figured why not  might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.  They needed to order one part  which would take about a week.  The following Thursday I get a phone call that the part was in and I immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and I left it with them.  Before I left  I asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.  I was told they would try to get to it on Friday  and if not I'd have it early next week.\\n\\nGreat!  I'm all excited  it's just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days  but it'll be worth it.  So 4th of July weekend comes and goes  didn't get my bike on Friday  (Monday was the 4th) Tuesday  or Wednesday.  So on Thursday  I call and they tell me that they've been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didn't come in over the holiday weekend to work.  He can't give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.  No call Thursday.  On Friday I call again.  It's now a week after they told me I should expect my bike.  They inform me that they should be getting to it that day.  Low and behold  late afternoon I get a phone call that it's ready.  At 5 after work  I go and pick it up.  I pay them and I ride home without a problem.  \\n\\nYesterday  I rode to work without a problem.  When I went home last night  the gears started skipping.  I wasn't having this problem before they fixed the bike though  so I was very confused.  This morning  I'm on my way to work  just pulling out of my street onto Neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.  I also got hit!!  Scared the hell out of me.  A normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because I couldn't get proper power out of my bike.\\n\\nToday at 11  when the shop opened  I was their first customer.  I brought the bike in and the tech took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.  The chain is 4 days old.  So he fixed it free of charge by just replacing the broken link.  Either way  I don't like the fact that a chain broke so easily.  I paid over $120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.\\n\\nLike I said at the top  I'll never go back...",

It made me contemplate the important questions in life:  How much should price factor into yelp* ratings?  Should I be more lenient bc it's a lunch spot while at work?  Answers to come..\\n\\nHow much should price factor into yelp* ratings?  Price should factor only into the quality of food  not quantity.  They give more food than you can eat  but the limiting factor is the quality.  \\n\\nVegetables - they come from the back kitchen where we don't see it getting made.  The vegetables have definitely been overcooked.  If you can pull a discernible texture from each veggie in there  props to you.  Carrots  zuchini  brocolli  bok choi  all tasted the same and had same texture.  I don't even know why it's in there - it hardly plays off the rice/protein.  Perhaps if the veggies still had a little crunch in them and weren't soggy and soaked for hours it would go well. I'm just saying.\\n\\nChicken/Rice - average but nothing spectacular.  Anytime chicken is cut into small pieces when it could be served in larger pieces  the protein is suspect.  \\n\\nWould I go here again? I don't think so.

Each Y charges a different price and now you have to pay a premium to go to another Y in the valley (at least that is what I was told!).  In the past we have supported the Y by donating to them through the Valley of the Sun United Way  etc. but I think this is unfair marketing tactics depending on who you talk to on the phone.

The wine list is less than impressive and anyone that actually enjoys drinking wine wouldn't settle for a wine bar with a wine list that is dominated by wine from California. Yes  names like \\\"\"\"\"Little Black Dress\\\"\"\"\" are cute but this isn't a quality selection. But the kiddies have got to start somewhere when they are learning about wine and that is the purpose of La Bocca. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes...well... the Mediterranean salad is good. Get that. I can't say that I would suggest the bruschetta. The flavors are lacking in creativity and they are often poorly constructed. The pizza is ok  but like I said  stick to that salad. \\n\\nShould you find yourself on Mill you could do much  much worse.

Lucky for him & the company he wasn't there.\\n\\nKnow what you need from car rental places before you get to the counter.  Check with YOUR insurance company and know what they will cover on rental cars...typically they have the coverage you need already.  No need to waste the extra $10 a day with the car rental companies.  \\n\\nReject the full tank gas option if you know you'll have time to gas up...you really have to get down to a low amount of gas to make the full tank option worth it even with the lower price on gas that they offer.  If you know you won't have the 5-10 minutes to gas up  I guess it would be worth it too.\\n\\nBottom line is that I might rent from Advantage in the future but if they pull something like this again  I'm recording the conversation and sending it to whatever consumer protection department I need to.\"",

I almost felt like I was inside of some crazy circus maze and all the employees were a bunch of mute fashionistas that just walked around flipping their hair.\\n\\nI was never greeted a single time  never offered one of those shopping bags I saw them walking around with  and I was never said  \\\"\"\"\"excuse me\\\"\"\"\" to when the employees would brush by me. It also seemed like the employees walked around aimlessly as if they were as confused as I was. They really should have a map of this store  so you'd at least know where you were going. I spent about 30 minutes upstairs walking around in circles until I decided to go downstairs to look at the accessories. I gotta admit  the accessory sections are actually very nicely organized  so I was able to find 2 pairs of feather earrings right away and I spent less than $10 on both of them. The shoe section was just a little awkward because there were about 4 employees walking around as if they were suppose to help you (none of which said anything to anyone there) and only ONE small bench. Actually  there were two benches  but the second bench was occupied by a giant mannequin! Needless to say  I didn't buy any shoes.\\n\\nI ended up walking out of Forever 21 with a skirt  2 pairs of earrings  a pair of shorts  and a Massive Headache. \\n\\nI feel like they don't really care about customer service at all here since they know they'll make their sales anyway. None of the employees ever said anything to me either when I was walking around  at the shoe section  or at the dressing rooms. The store is also overwhelming with its size and loud music. The only thing I can't complain about are the prices and styles  which is probably going to have me coming back here.\"",

Eager to venture out on our own  we decided to try NOCA. \\n\\nWhile there  we chose the tasting menu.  We began with a mis which consisted of a balsamic cured strawberry with a marcona almond. Yum.  Hubby started off with the Reuben and I had the avocado soup.  Both were delicious.  The pasta course was tasty.  For the main course  hubby had the veal and I had the sturgeon.  Both were perfectly cooked and perfectly paired.  Desert included complimentary cotton candy along with a peanut butter smores dish which may have been the crown jewel of the evening  and a peach shortbread which was also very delicious.\\n\\nIt is not often that I eat out and feel that desserts are on par with the general menu  but NOCA was an adventure from the mis all the way to the after-dinner cordials!",

The pita is lightly toasted and goes very well with the Gyros meat and yogurt sauce. Ann has the standard eggs  bacon and American fries and has not been disappointed.

Alternatively  are you looking for something just a little bit different to do on a lazy summer day? \\n\\nOk  ok  all kidding aside - you may find yourselves (as we did yesterday) with more broken-down boxes and odd-shaped trash (old floor lamps  etc.) than can fit in your bins. This waste facility allows Phoenix residents to dump bulk trash and recyclables for free once a month. \\n\\nTo get to the facility  drive down to 27th Avenue and Buckeye (aka \\\"\"\"\"No Man's Land\\\"\"\"\"). When you drive up  you will likely see a long line of commercial vehicles waiting to do their daily or weekly dump. You can bypass this line and go to the R (the sign says something like \\\"\"\"\"Visitors\\\"\"\"\"). When I say \\\"\"\"\"you can \\\"\"\"\" what I mean is that we did without being stopped  so you should be able to as well. According to the city website  we were supposed to have to show a driver's license and recent water bill to be let in  but no one stopped us or asked for proof of anything. \\n\\nWe drove around and around the facility  following signs that directed us to the visitors' drop-off area  until finally we arrived at a massive pile of garbage. Literally. There were tons of guys in pick-up trucks dumping yard clippings  as well as a few ordinary people  like us  who just wanted their garage to be less cluttered. Warning to the wise - the place stinks (it's filled with garbage  after all) and the ground is wet and a bit slippery. We wore flip-flops (how dumb were we?). If you go  you might want to wear a long-sleeved shirt and some old  crappy tennis shoes you don't give a crap about. \\n\\nAfter dumping our trash  we looked around for the recycling drop-off. Some random employee sitting out under an umbrella told us that the bins were full and that we should just dump our massive pile of cardboard boxes into the trash pile (real ringing endorsement for city-sponsored recycling  huh?). I told him that we didn't want to just trash all that recyclable material  so he suggested going over by the employee trailers and dumping it in their recycling bin. So we did. \\n\\nI have to admit that after coming all the way to a city facility dedicated to proper recycling  we felt a bit odd dumping all these boxes in a tiny bin that wasn't much bigger than our bin at home. We felt as if we had gone to a public swimming pool and found it to be the same size as our inflatable one. We also wondered if the boxes would even get recycled. Fortunately  a guy in a city truck showed up towards the end of our unloading  gave us the thumbs up  and waited for us to be done so he could unload the bin and take the materials to wherever recyclables go to die and be reborn as new  environmentally-friendly objects. \\n\\nOur trip to this facility was an adventure  that's for sure. In addition to (or in spite of?) the educational benefits of seeing the inner workings of the city's solid waste operations and the entertainment value of all of those unfamiliar sights  sounds  and smells  we got to rid ourselves of the massive piles of trash and boxes left over from our move and early home improvement projects in one fell swoop. Can't beat that!\"",

I walked into the men's room as one of the cooks (shorter guy with a beard) was finishing at the urinal  when he finished  he walked out without washing his hands! Out of the corner of my eye a second cook who was in the stall walked out of the stall and also did not wash his hands! Gross! I pointed it out to our waiter and he said he would say something to the one person whom I was able to recognize and I opted to not have him say anything (for obvious reasons). The waiter offered that they have a hand washing station near the kitchen and the gentlemen probably washed their hands there....I'm not buying it. I know I may be somewhat of a germaphobe but that is inexcusable for a chef who is making salads and things which are not cooked to do something like this...furthermore  it is a major health code violation!

We were dumb enough to buy and we were lied to mislead through this ENTIRE process.  Prior to arrival we were told they 'wanted' us to check in early. Upon arrival  we had to wait hours to check in.  Rosie held our luggage for us and was WONDERFULLLL - Bluegreen should give her a raise.  Then prior to arrival we were told we would get 1 free show ticket and can purchase another ticket at their prices.  When we arrived they looked at us like were crazy.  We didn't get a free ticket  we paid full price for 2 tickets and were given a book with a red cover for 'coupons' after looking through the book there were BOGO offers for the same show in the book they gave us AFTER we bought full price tickets from them.  Next day we went to the presentation  after 5 hours of saying no I finally looked at them and said what do I have to do to get out of here.  They made us an offer plus they were going to 'throw' in a one time 8000 points.  They wanted to put this purchase on a credit card with zero percent interest/no payments for 6 months.  They had 2 credit card offers.  We said MANY times we DO NOT want 2 credit cards.  We go to closing and they had ran our credit for both credit cards and only at closing did they tell us the 'extra' points are white season only - this was NEVER mentioned during the presentation.  They offered us two one week vacations through RCI and were told we could use these anytime for any room  we have been trying to make reservations for these two weeks...ya nada.  Because we spent 5 hours of one of our days there I asked for a late checkout... they gave me an extra 2 hours however I heard someone else in the elevator say they asked for a late checkout because of the presentation and they allowed them to stay until 2:00 PM!!!  Then we get home and we get 2 credit different cards in the mail and they put half our purchase on one and half on the other when we had MORE (Thousands) more to our limit and did not need two credit cards.  We can only figure they must get  kick back.   We also found out the credit cards are not 0%/no payments for 6 months just another lie they told us.  HIGH PRESSURE your not getting out of there without a purchase.  It was one lie after another - will NEVER attend another presentation and we are thinking seriously of selling this 'vacation package'... JOKE",

I bought blueberries and Granny Smith apples  and although they were both well priced  they were off and rotten inside when I ate them - such a waste of money.  \\n\\nIt was only recently that I discovered that Fresh Choice had been fined \\u00a3300 in January 2009 for selling food that was past its use by date.  If you do go to this shop check the sell by date on thier fresh produce or perhaps stick to their dried and canned foods which can't really go off.   \\n\\nPerhaps not a Fresh Choice after all.",

It covers everything that you could possibly need for your home.  There's paint  DIY equipment  plants  home accessories and furnishings and more besides.  They also provide a delivery service  meaning that there's no need to trek out to a B&Q or Homebase  when a place as big as this is probably just on your doorstep.\\n\\nHonestly  I was impressed with this place.  It crams in a lot of stuff  and will succeed in dragging people away from the big chains to something more local.  These people are definitely getting it right in my opinion.",

As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it  it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star.

A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door  the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance. \\n\\nAfter the long conversation  the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating  the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us. \\n\\nFinally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite  the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently  they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that  my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize! \\n\\nMy blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu  take it off don't double the price.

Mostly everything I have tried at Tandoori Times has been good. The naan is so fresh and warm  and when you request spicy  that's what you get. Enter the mango lassi  which is really good. It helps cool your mouth when you're eating something fiery.\\n\\nThe only thing I have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings  as there was less meat on them than I have seen on any chicken wing  plus it was WAY too spicy. I also felt like $10 was way too much to ask when you have to basically get your nutrition from the dish by sucking on bones. But  hey...who am I to judge  right? Had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish  I might have given it another try. However  bleeding from my esophagus is not how I'd like to spend my lunch hour. \\n\\nAside from the wings from hell  I love Tandoori Times. It is authentic  affordable and right around the corner from my job. 4 stars.",

I was so excited to finally come here with my coworker after trying to schedule lunch for over two months and this is our usual place. We came in at 12:20 and placed our order and my coworker asked for a small side of sauce for the dish that I had ordered. At approximately 1:10  another server came to our table to tell us that our order was somehow lost but they were working on it now. Fifteen minutes after that  the food finally came out. The food  as expected  was delicious. So much so that conversation ceased. Then came the check. First  they charged the full value of a dish ($12.95) for the side of sauce...again sauce for a dish they were already preparing!! Just the sauce cost as much as the dish I ordered. So...we bring it to their attention and request they pay for the appetizer  since we waited practically an hour for it. They come back with a revised check. The sauce...just the sauce...now only cost $7.95!!! For a side of sauce...tomato based curry sauce! Seriously?! I could have just given her my leftover sauce! And the discount we got was 10%. Making for a $40+ lunch for two that took an hour and a half!! With no alcohol!! Where is the customer service? Seriously?!?!!! I won't be coming back!",

Boy did I regret that! For $11  I ordered the Oreo Frrrozen Hot Chocolate  and it was pretty enough.  After drinking a bit  I realized that I could easily make this myself.  The ice wasn't that well blended  and it was mostly whipped cream.\\n\\nSerendipity 3 appears to think they can get away with having inflated prices with sub par food because there is a lot of hype surrounding them.  They may have duped me into it  but don't let yourself be next.",

They have more flavors  more toppings  fancy water (with strawberries floating in them)  cool spoons  and yogurt prices that aren't too harsh on my wallet.  Also  I think they have a more ice cream-like texture but since it's yogurt  I can lie to myself that this might actually be healthier than the tub of ice cream I have sitting in the freezer. But all that aside  I give this location in particular  1 star.\\n\\nSo sometimes at the Tempe location  about half the yogurt dispensers are down. Fine  it's a high traffic location  machines need some care too. Whatever  I can deal with less flavors. Sometimes the toppings aren't stocked. Sure  I don't need any more than a scoop of this and a scoop of that.  Again  not a big deal.  Most of the time  the crew has yogurt stains on their shirts.  Again  whatever.  The machines are down  they need to be fixed.  Yogurt accidents are inevitable.  But this was the final straw.\\n\\nBUGS.  The tiny flying ones that love to swarm at you in the evenings.  The ones with green  translucent wings.  And other unidentifiable bugs that I just call gross.  On all of the toppings.  On the sneeze guards  on the spoons  in the toppings  on the fruits.\\n\\nSo now I drive the extra 5 or so miles to the Scottsdale or Chandler location to get my Yogurtland fix.

Only TWO of these stairclimbers now work (one of which has been broken since the Spring).  Please see the photo above.  Instead of replacing equipment that continues to break month after month  LA Fitness will just slap an out of order sign on it and call it a day.  Suffice it to say that they have not purchased a single piece of new cardio equipment in years because it would actually cost money.  Speaking of investing in the facility  the carpets are so full of crusty sweat and mildew that the stench permeating from the building is starting to get nauseating.  The absence of towels and the lack of a proper amount of sanitizer and paper goods throughout the gym makes this situation worse by the day.  Anyone know if 24 Hour Fitness is having a membership promo these days?  I would RUN off the treadmills at LA Fitness now to find out.",

He was staggering around  waving his arms  stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg)  taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour  except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting  but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers  you have to pay  which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale  but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process  though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany  and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product.",

She didnt repeat the order  but said the total amount and took our card. it took about ten mins to get two smoothies  a kids cheese quesadilla and chicken Cesar salad. The girl apologize for the wait but that's all she said. We were hoping the food was fresh since it took so long but that wasn't true. \\nThe quesadilla was alright  one of the smoothie was missing the sweetener  and the salad oh my gosh was nasty. It was old  and had a weird color on the leaves. If you're gonna be open for 24/7 restock your food with some fresh ones.",

You win  Menchie's.\\n\\nP.S. - Kudos to whoever inputted the store hours on Yelp.  Their web site says they close at 10pm  which I would have taken at face value if not for Yelp.  I called  and their web site is wrong and Yelp is right.  So there!",

The mattress is imprinted with Bassett's name  we bought the mattress from Bassett  so Bassett should cover it under the 5year warranty. They offered to replace the mattress with a downgraded replacement. They kept pushing that since they didn't carry my original mattress in stock any more and kept telling me they are actually doing me a favor by offering to replace the mattress( mind you ... a mattress that is still under warranty) and I should take whatever they are offering. Finally  they offered to replace the mattress with another mattress that they told me is actually an upgrade. At the time of delivery when I got the name of the mattress  I looked it up and found out that it was a significant downgrade. Not only that but they told me in no uncertain terms that they won't replace the box spring. I bought these two as a pair.

Sunpower called me two weeks ago to follow up that everything was complete. I told them I had no idea since no one has contacted me. I still have heard nothing. \\nRUN!

They used fear tactics (saying we were going to \\\"\"\"\"lose our Palm Canyon\\\"\"\"\") even though we have a deed.\\n\\n They also told us we could purchase more points and write it off of our taxes (not true)  that closing costs have to be included by California law (not true) and while using fear tactics about a special assessment fee we could be charged by the parent company who originally owned our timeshare  they tried to get us to sign up for two sets of maintenance fees for the same property. I told them I am retired/disabled and on a fixed income  yet they were going to make sure I spent some money before I got out of there. A 55 minute \\\"\"\"\"update\\\"\"\"\" turned into hours and hours- we spent an entire vacation day haggling over what mostly turned out to be b.s. The information presented is very confusing  misleading and the way it is presented is not ethical. Bait and switch galore!  I am a California Insurance agent and if I were to do business in the way they do  I would lose my license.\"",

When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon  his blood pressure was 177/87  and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later  he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit  they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.

GIRLS  if y'all are on guestlist  do yourself a favor and GET THERE EARLY and WAY before noon.  Summer is just a prime time for Vegas as everyone loves dayclubs  so getting there around 11:30 and thinking you'll get in for free on guestlist requires a flat out miracle.  The guestlist line int he back for girls is LONG and takes forever as they hold the line to make sure all the guys/pre-sales/tables get in first.  Don't think you'll still get in for free.  By the time my girls and I got to the front  it was past 12  and they wouldn't let us in until we paid the $20 cover.\\n\\n2.  EBC is strict.  Self-explanatory.  XS is strict also  so don't expect any special treatment or anything sneaky. \\n\\n3.  Drinks are ridiculous.  Now I can't speak for other dayclubs  but our guys spend about $100 for a round of 4 drinks. So that's just a ballpark. \\n\\n4. Along those lines  EBC is pricey.  Get over it. It's vegas and it's one of the most popular dayclubs.  \\n\\n5. This place is HUGE.  So yes  it gets crowded  but it's covers a LARGE area so there's room to dance  run around  and drink away. \\n\\nOverall  I loved this place.  BUT I wasn't sold on the guestlist management.  Totally understand that they have to get all the pre-sale people in  but they took forever ON PURPOSE so they could charge as many people as they could.",

He informed our server that he was a pescatarian (only eats seafood). The server had to ask the kitchen if he could substitute shrimp. Of course the answer was yes. About two slices in  not realizing because of how hungry we were  he noticed bacon pieces all over the pizza. When we told the server his response was \\\"\"\"\"I'll have them make another one.\\\"\"\"\" No apology or expression at all. After that of course we didn't want another one. Took about 5 minutes for the manager to come over. Of course he apologized and took the pizza off. Feeding meat to someone that doesn't eat meat is a pretty big deal. The pizza was taken off but that was it. They even left the pizza on the table. Why would we want a reminder of the mistake that occurred and stare at a pizza you can't eat. I expect a lil more compensation for something like that. Not looking for a free meal in any way. In a situation like that  i would expect more than just taking off the mistake.

So stellt sich also der durchschnittliche Gast ein spanisches Restaurant vor? Das denken anscheinend die Erfinder dieser Art von Gastronomie.\\n\\n\\n Was es sonst von unserem Besuch zu berichten gibt  ist leider nicht besser.\\n\\n\\n Nach 15 Minuten stelle ich fest  dass die Herren an dem einen Nachbartisch untereinander spanisch reden  mit dem Kellner dagegen englisch.\\n\\n\\n Nach 20 Minuten wundere ich mich  dass noch nicht mal Brot auf dem Tisch steht  obwohl die Gl\\u00e4ser l\\u00e4ngst wieder leer sind und bekomme als Kommentar vom Nachbartisch  ich solle erst mal warten bis das Essen kommt  bevor ich mich beschwere.\\n\\n\\n Als ich 25 Minuten nach der Bestellung den Kellner frage  warum man nicht zumindest Aioli mit Brot servieren k\\u00f6nne  erkl\\u00e4rt dieser  dass es nicht am fehlenden Personal liege  sondern daran  dass der Grill nicht ausreiche  um die Bestellungen schneller zu bearbeiten. Als ich ihm erkl\\u00e4re  dass Aioli nicht vom Grill kommt  geht er freundlicherweise in die K\\u00fcche und bringt das Aioli mit Brot (1 80 EUR).\\n\\n\\n Leider. Wer einmal Aioli selbst gemacht hat  sieht und schmeckt sofort  dass es nicht hausgemacht ist  sondern aus dem Eimer stammt. Ein genauer Blick auf die Speisekarte  auf der die enthaltenen Zusatzstoffe bezeichnet sind  best\\u00e4tigt dies.\\n\\n\\n Cangrejos en miel (4 60 EUR) schmecken wie Krabbencocktail in den 80ern.\\n\\n\\n Verduras Mediterraneas (3 40 EUR) waren das Highlight des Abends. N\\u00e4mlich tats\\u00e4chlich ganz ohne Aromastoffe  Farbstoffe  Geschmacksverst\\u00e4rker und Verdickungsmittel. Die Zucchini und Paprika haben recht ordentlich geschmeckt. Zuhause h\\u00e4tte ich ein natives Oliven\\u00f6l verwendet  aber so anspruchsvoll darf man im Besitos nicht sein.\\n\\n\\n Patatas Bravas (2 90 EUR) sollten knusprige Kartoffelecken mit kanarischer Salsa sein. Tats\\u00e4chlich waren es nicht knusprige Kartoffelecken in einer Art Ketchup-Mayonaise.\\n\\n\\n Die Datiles en bacon (4 60 EUR) sollen ganz lecker gewesen sein  aber ich esse keinen Speck. Auch hier: Zusatzstoffe.\\n\\n\\n Nichts zu meckern gab es auch an den Gambas al ajilio (4 40 EUR).\\n\\n\\n Aber dann kam die Paella de marisco (13 40 EUR). Die dunkle Eisenpfanne sollte wohl suggerieren  dass hier authentisch gekocht wurde. Wurde es aber nicht. Der Reis war noch sehr k\\u00f6rnig  dazwischen M\\u00f6hrenw\\u00fcrfel und Erbsen  denen man die Herkunft aus der Tiefk\\u00fchltruhe ansah und auch  dass sie diese erst vor kurzem verlassen hatten. F\\u00fcr die Meeresfr\\u00fcchte galt dasselbe. Die Geschmacksrichtung der Br\\u00fche  die sich nach einigen Minuten am Boden der Pfanne sammelte  l\\u00e4sst sich recht gut als Knorr-Fertigpfanne-Paella beschreiben. Und selbst dieses Gericht kam nicht ohne Zusatzstoffe aus.\\n\\n\\n Das Selters war gut  die Sangria ok. Die Bedienung war gut  wirklich freundlich und dem Kellner ist seine Loyalit\\u00e4t gegen\\u00fcber der K\\u00fcche zugute zu halten. Er beharrte darauf  dass dort tats\\u00e4chlich gekocht wird.

Aber immerhin wird man schnell satt.\\n\\n\\n Der Innenhof ist noch so sch\\u00f6n  wie zu Weinbrenner-Zeiten und war dementsprechend voll.\\n\\n\\n Wer aber noch wei\\u00df  wie selber gekochtes Essen schmeckt  sollte diesen Platz unbedingt meiden.

We aren't too picky and didn't care that much that we had to wave her over for things like water and coffee. We were more interested in enjoying our company but what I do have a problem with is getting orders wrong TWICE and not comping my roommates meal. She is lactose intolerant and gluten free so eating out can be stressful but breakfast is really easy. She ordered the chorizo scramble and wanted bacon added and no cheese. SO EASY. It came to her with NO BACON and EXTRA cheese. She sent it back. It came back with no cheese and NO BACON. She was so hungry at this point and we had finished eating so she just didn't say anything. I said something because it's ridiculous. I don't even think the woman apologized. When I mentioned she again did not get the bacon the woman just gave her a side. Not the same as having it in the scramble as she asked for. Twice at this point.\\n\\nYou guys should not have charged her for the meal and certainly should not have charged her EXTRA for the very late bacon.

The silver age  war and horror (old school subjects  from the 60s/70s) drawers are still empty. I collect silver age  but I don't have a specific item that I am looking for  I basically browse the drawers and if a cover appeals to me I buy it. To me not having a structure in my collecting makes it more fun  I don't need to complete a full run and any random book or subject is just fine with me. The cover art is what I am mostly looking for (since 90% of the time the story in the book lets you down in relation to the exciting cover art). I really liked it when they had several drawers full of silver age that I could concentrate on and they were located in one place towards the beginning of the line of drawers. Now you can find silver age  but they are mixed into all the other hundreds of subjects and those drawers are so full you can't even look through them without removing a huge stack so you can take a look. Some drawers are so tight  you can't even remove some to make room  other drawers are packed so loose that the books are falling over damaging other books and folding them.\\nI did manage to find a few items that totalled about $15  but when I checked out  again no mention of the rewards program. Again this is a sticking point with me  since for all the years I was buying there it was at about the $250 in total purchases that I was finally offered a card for the rewards program. Ugh!",

It's like the time I went to the Cheesecake Factory and ordered some Chinese food and complain it didn't taste very good. Maybe I should've figured out that their specialty has less to do with Chinese food and more to do with their actual restaurant name (It can't be factories  so it must be cheesecakes  right?). I can't tell you about their cheesecakes because I didn't have any. Whoa  anyways  sorry for going off on a slight tangent.  I can assure you I wasn't as brainless this time  and I originally planned to eat some steak until I saw their hot dog menu. I ordered their Chicago dog  and because I had some wine a couple hours ago I thought a shake wasn't necessary. I was conscious of my decision and yearned for something out of the ordinary. \\n\\nI ate their Chicago dog with a side serving of fries. Gotta say it was pretty damn good. The color of the relish was unbelievable. I actually didn't even know it was relish until I tasted it. It was so diced to the point it looked like a completely different vegetable. The fries were killer as well. They were thin and crunchy  kinda like the ones from McDonalds  but not drenched in oil nor salt.\\n\\nThe place was jampacked and the waiting time was pretty long.

These are a delight within their own.  Golden french fries covered with brown gravy  mushrooms  and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself (we asked them to leave the cheese off since I am lactose intolerant).\\n\\nFor dessert  we had a piece of lavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peak!!\\n\\nSummary:  The burgers were truly a pure delight!!

The first my friends and I ate at Tien Wong  we had ordered the Ying-Yang pot  which had the spicy and mild on each side  it was okay.  This time  we ordered the Lemon Grass one. Which I highly recommend!!! It was so much better than the Ying-Yang.  \\n\\nNEVER NEVER NEVER get the quail eggs.  It was a waste of money.  and make sure to get lots and lots of beef slices.  That's like my favorite part of eating hot pot.  I like eating the clear Asian noodles one the most...it doesn't make the broth all thick after putting the noodles intot he broth like the udon noodles.  \\n\\nI also really like the fact that they're open really late.

I told her that we did not want to eat anymore and she said that she would bring me my check for the cocktails that we ordered. I would expect this from some restaurants but not one in the cosmopolitan and surly not one that I am going to drop over $400 on one meal. I understand that this happens as they said to me after I was stabbed in the mouth  but the way the staff handled it was not appropriate.

You won't want to waste 30 minutes ordering drinks once you get into the club  trust me.\\n\\nEverything about Marquee is unreal  but amazing: the lights flashing everywhere  the music booming (all you hear is pounding bass!)  the go-go dancers  and all of the secret passageways to the different dance rooms. The main dance floor spins House/Club/Trance  and if you don't want to squeeze your way in  you can forget about dancing in there - it gets packed. \\n\\nIn the \\\"\"\"\"library\\\"\"\"\" they spin Rap & Hip-Hop; it's called the library because there are book shelves along the walls.

A diner should appreciate the finest flavors orchestrated into smaller dishes  which is how we received our servings. If you're looking for places that serve up large piles of food and multiple napkins  kindly skip my reviews. \\n\\nEater.com says that this hidden restaurant is one of the hardest reservations to get. All we did to get them was email the website *exactly* one month in advance and wait. In fact  we waited a week without word but were able to secure a reservation for the requested night. They also explained that they are very busy (as you can imagine) and they are almost always booked solid.\\n\\nOnce you secure your reservations  you'll get a pair of Golden tickets (just like Willy Wonka) by mail. If you live farther than the East Coast  you probably won't get it in time for the event. But they'll still let you in.\\n\\nOn the night of dinner  get there at least 15 minutes in advance. Have one of Jose's signature Ultimate Gin and Tonics because it really is the ultimate.\\n\\nTip: Ask the head chef for permission to take pictures as a courtesy. You will be allowed to but you cannot take video (a shame) or use a flash (also a shame  because it's dim in there). When they begin their choreographed assembly of each disk (and I wonder how often they practice)  you'll see that flash photography would interfere with their procedures.\\n\\nEight seats. Twenty three dishes. Wine supplements were skipped. Nearly all were consumed in two bites.\\n\\n\\nGin & Tonic\\nSpanish Clavel\\nBeet Jewelry\\nCaramelized Pork Rinds\\nApple \\\"\"\"\"Brazo de Gitano\\\"\"\"\"\\nNitro Almond Cup\\nCrispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche\\nJos\\u00e9 Taco\\nOlive Sferica Ferran Adria (Spherical Olives!!)\\nBocata de \\\"\"\"\"Calamares\\\"\"\"\"\\nCava Sangria\\n\\nArtichoke Puree w/ Vanilla\\nLobster with Citrus and Jasmine\\nChickpea Stew with Ib\\u00e9rico Ham\\nTurbot with Bone Marrow - GF's favorite dish\\nRosemary Wild Mushrooms in Papillote\\nSecreto of Ib\\u00e9rico Pork with Squid\\n\\nOrange Pith Pur\\u00e9e La Serena\\nFlan\\nPan Con Chocolate\\n\\\"\"\"\"Arroz Con Leche\\\"\"\"\"\\nFizzy Paper\\n25 Second Bizcocho\\n\\\"\"\"\"Air\\\"\"\"\" Chocolates\\n\\nLet's face it - you'll be overwhelmed in no time. How do you keep track of each dish *and* take pictures of each? Not easy.\\n\\nEach dish is composed with fine detail and precision  and Chef Brett took time to describe each (after they were handed to each guest). He also answered any/all questions from the guests while we ate.\\n\\nOur favorite dishes were:\\n\\nFried Bone Marrow - Possibly the greatest flavor I've ever experienced. The GF lost her mind over this also.\\n\\nFried Chicken Skin w/ Oysters and Caviar - If you love chicken skin   this will rock your world. Two bites.\\n\\nAt the end of dinner  you will be assigned a unique diner's number based on the total number of diners to date. You will then be asked to sign a personal note to Jose in a small book that others have done previously.\\n\\nThe bill came out to $540-something for two including tip. This was the finest display of molecular gastronomy I've ever experienced. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!\"",

        "text": "\"gasp. 1/2 star docked. like any new restaurant  i guess i should have expected fluctuations in all aspects of the restaurant  food and operation wise. \\n\\nmy friend and i have made it our goal to come here once a week on a weekend night for half off burgers. so here's the update on business hours of operation: they still offer half off for the same menu items (including the same exclusions)  but they don't let you modify any of the standard burgers by adding anything (like lettuce or tomato for example) - they only let you take off toppings.  the half off still takes place during the last hour of their day  but they have cut short their days. they close Sun-Thurs at 10 (or 10:30? i'm leaning towards 10)  and Fri-Sat at 11PM.  We came here tonight at 10:34PM  and while we were eating our food we could sense them starting to rush us  which prompted me to ask about their hours. so that means half off Sun-Thurs 9-10  and Fri-Sat 10-11.\\n\\nupdates on the food:\\n\\nAppetizers- after ordering two appetizers last week  we decided to get the same bangkok steak fries and a sonoma chicken salad instead of nachos.  the bangkok steak fries changed! to my dismay  they inundated the mushroom with the tempura batter  making the final result too crispy for my liking (although some people may like it better).  they did give thick mushroom slices only  however  and they also presented it differently  stacked 2 parallel on the bottom  two perpendicular to the first level  and 1 on the top. no minced green onion as garnish.) the sonoma chicken salad came with a legit serving of chicken  but lacked a bit on the actual greens.  for a salad that usually costs 11 dollars  i would not have paid that much to get a slightly small quantity of baby spinach (as much of a premium baby spinach is).  pictures for both of these will be uploaded and dated (i forgot to bring an actual camera again. sorry...)\\n\\nBurgers -\\nDO NOT ASK FOR THE BURGERS WELL DONE. \\n\\nreminiscient of the jump in difficulty from medium to hard in rock band or guitar hero  the jump in wellness between slightly pink and well done is a bit too big.  last time my friend asked for the morty steakhouse burger medium well  and it was pink in the center  but still tasted juicy and tender.  this time he said \\\"\"\"\"well done\\\"\"\"\" to his farmer john burger  and i said \\\"\"\"\"just a tiny bit of pink\\\"\"\"\" to my morty steakhouse burger. those patties were definitely a bit too well-done.  i'll remember to say slightly pink next time. regardless  the quality of the meat itself is still great. the peppercorn rub was definitely memorable and aromatic. the only complaint i heard from my friend was that the ham slice in his burger was thinner than he anticipated  but i explained that it was probably so you could bite through it  instead of trying to bite through it and pulling the whole slice out of the burger (pet peeve).  we both were able to substitute fries in place of the potato chips for a dollar extra.  the fries were well seasoned  not steak fries  and not very crispy (i.e. if you like to pick up a fry and have it stay completely straight like a mcdonalds fry  don't get these fries.  i'd liken the softness of these fries to those of In N Out  for anyone currently on this side of the coast who has actually tried them)  \\n\\noverall  this visit hasn't deterred me from visiting any less often. i'm sure they're still straightening things out  and i hope to see them revert the way they make their bangkok steak fries back the way they first served them to me!\\n\\np.s. not to be a iphone check-in snob  but is there any way to tell yelp that they have the waterworks mall tagged at the wrong location? that location is too far away for me to check into any place at the waterworks mall.\"",

Unfortunately for me  Grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.  While my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.  This evening I ordered a pizza to-go which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.  Not so.  My son and I stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.  Then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the two girls who were handling take out orders away from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.  Mind you  this is in the midst of a Sunday night take out rush.  After the second girl got her \\\"\"\"\"talking to\\\"\"\"\" I watched as she tried to compose herself (unsuccessfully) and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.  That left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the to-go traffic since the Manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her \\\"\"\"\"talks\\\"\"\"\" with the to-go staff.  The remaining girl jumped between calls while to-go orders piled up below her counter.  I had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzas was mine  since I had now been waiting over 25 minutes  but I had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes the girl started checking the pizzas and  just as I had assumed  brought me mine from the pile.  When I told her that I knew that this pizza had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame excuse that it was very busy tonight.   \\nI have at least 5-10 other pizza places I pass on my way to this place and Grimaldis just gave me an excuse to either try the others again or give them a first try before I return to this place.\"",

Nowhere near medium! On top of that  it was smothered with caramelized onions  which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak! The service was average. Nothing great. Overall  I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally  I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation  only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant  as far as I'm concerned!",

They have animals stacked in crates right by the windows (not sure if these are owned dogs that are boarded or if that is the \\\"\"\"\"puppy sales department\\\"\"\"\"). I'm not sure how big the place is inside  but they could easily figure out a floor plan where the dogs could be kenneled where they can actually sleep. Being kenneled in a strange environment is hard enough  but Puppy Land has them kenneled where they are subject to patrons of the plaza hitting the windows and barking at them. Even the passers-by that weren't being obnoxious didn't see the problem with tapping on the window  talking to them  or using body language the dogs might see as \\\"\"\"\"challenging.\\\"\"\"\" There is also light from the plaza that comes in that window  even at night. Other areas of the facility were much darker from what I could tell.\\n\\nBottom line: If you are going to open a business that caters to pet care  make sure you are taking care of the pets. They are not products. They are not dollar signs. They are living things that need all of the advocates they can find. And the dogs in this establishment deserve some alone time at night- living in a kennel is stressful enough. They don't need us humans having easy access to bother them.\"",

They should have called me right then and there and said were sorry we dont deliver and we would have gone to pick it up... but NOOOO instead We waited 45 minutes ( they say on their site expect 30 to 45 minute wait depends on time of day ) then i called to find out the status and was notified they needed to caller the owner and he would call me back..... \\n\\nOwner calls me and gives me excuse after excuse as to why they cant \\\\ dont deliver and doesnt even offer me a discount just basically tells me sorry for waiting for 45 minutes all we will do is give you a refund. \\n\\n\\nI will not be going here because they are false advertising the fact they deliver and cannot accept plain excuses from an owner who obviously has no idea what they are doing.\\n\\nSo now im out 45 minutes of my personal time   i could easily be enjoying some hot enjoyable cheesesteaks but now i never will and will tell every one i know to stay away from here.  \\n\\nThe owner and this company does not deserve to be in business. \\n\\nPLAIN AND SIMPLE.\\n\\nP.S.  To the owner if you actually see these... take delivery off your website ... its called false advertising......",

Delicious!  The Farmer's Market bene that is!  I will have to go back for the french toast.  I also had ordered a mimosa.  More alcohol please next time.",

The blend of flavors didn't save it. I'll have to give it a second chance and dine in  maybe try a specialty sandwich instead.",

Based on the other Yelp recommendations  we got the agedashi tofu (amaze balls)  chicken katsu curry (sauce was a little sweet)  tonkatsu (delightful)  yuzu soda (refreshing)  and the sweet potato cake dessert (LOVE)!  Chef came out and talked to us a couple times and was so nice!  I love the menu and the size of the restaurant.  Looking forward to coming back for dinner soon.",
